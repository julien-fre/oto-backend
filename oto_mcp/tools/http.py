"""`http` connector — generic multi-auth HTTP client (secret IN the oto vault).

To be distinguished from the bridge (`tools/remote.py`, ADR 0034): the bridge forwards to a
remote service that HOLDS the credential (custody outside the platform, M2M token);
here oto holds the target API's secret (AES-encrypted vault, byo_org) and calls
the API **directly**. The org configures on the HTTP card: `base_url`, `auth_mode`
(bearer/header/query/basic/oauth2/none) + the mode's secret(s).

Thin adapter (ADR 0037): the engine (auth + forward) lives in oto-core
(`oto.tools.http`); here we resolve the org credential and translate errors
into McpError. Three tools: `http_get` (read), `http_post` (POST with a JSON
body — paginated search, writes), `http_doc` (the API's contract, if
the operator filled in `doc_path` on the card — e.g. `/openapi.json` for a
bridge that exposes it behind the same auth as the rest).
It is an "HTTP node" (like n8n/Zapier), but the destination is controlled:
`oto_mcp/egress.py` refuses a `base_url` (or a `token_url`) that RESOLVES to an
internal address, except for a named exception declared at deployment. What a POST is
allowed to do is up to the target API (and, behind a bridge, ITS own
allowlist). Being ordinary MCP tools,
the result goes back through field redaction (FieldRedactionMiddleware).
