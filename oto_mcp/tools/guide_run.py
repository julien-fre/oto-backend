"""Runs — lifecycle verbs of a walkthrough (ADR 0017, rung 2).

`run_start` opens a run (mints a `run_id`, pushes it into the session state);
every tool call until `run_finish` is **attributed to that run** by the calllog
sink (server-side correlation, the agent threads nothing). A run with `guide`
= the execution of a named (repeatable) guide; without `guide` = a one-shot
(ad-hoc) run, same trace. Loading a guide remains `oto_procedure(op='get')`
(unchanged). Platform spine: loaded explicitly in `register_all`, outside the
activation gate.
