"""French ownership chain — go up to the group, down to the subsidiaries.

Signal #337. The need is to qualify a company's INDEPENDENCE, and it comes from a
costly false negative: in one campaign, 4 leads out of 5 were discarded because
INSEE classed them as "large company" — they were SUBSIDIARIES, small in their own right.
`categorie_entreprise` is computed by INSEE at the GROUP level, not at the level of the
entity; without the chain, it makes any size-based targeting lie.

## What the upstream can actually return (verified on 2026-08-28, not inferred)

- **Child → parent**: the RNE publishes the LEGAL-ENTITY officers with their
  SIREN. It is the same `dirigeants` block that `fr_get` already returns — the edge
  existed, it just wasn't assembled.
- **Parent → children**: the recherche-entreprises full-text index **indexes the
  officers**. Its OpenAPI says so ("q: terms for a text search
  (name and/or address, officers, elected members)") and the differential proves it:
  `q=LEFEBVRE SARRUT` returns FLS IMMOBILIER, EDITIONS LEGISTATIVES and SOCIETE CIVILE
  ARVIL, none of whose names shares a token with the query. It is the inverted index the
  signal asked us to build server-side: it already existed upstream.
- **What the upstream CANNOT do**: search by an officer's SIREN.
  `q=602060147` returns only Hachette Livre itself, and `nom_personne` targets only
  NATURAL persons (0 results on "LEFEBVRE SARRUT", verified). The index therefore
  returns CANDIDATES by name; we are the ones who prove the link, via the officer's
  SIREN. On `q=HACHETTE LIVRE`, 5 candidates out of 29 have no link to it
  (L'ESPRIT LIVRE, MATRA HACHETTE…): without this check, they would pass for
  subsidiaries.
- **Hard upstream limits**: `per_page` ≤ 25 (26 → HTTP 400) and `page × per_page`
  ≤ 10,000 (401 → HTTP 400). On a large group (BOUYGUES = 1,476 candidates),
  exhaustive downward traversal is therefore out of reach — and we SAY so.

## What this module refuses to guess

The beneficial-owners register has been closed to the public since 2026-07-31:
the real shareholding of a SAS is no longer accessible. A SAS with no legal-entity
officer is therefore NOT "independent", it is **undetermined** — and saying so is the
core of the tool, not its flaw. Observed on EDITIONS PAYOT ET RIVAGES: no
legal-entity officer other than the statutory auditor, whereas Actes Sud owns it
100%.

No writes, no credits: three open-data sources, read-only.

# Deloitte, RSM and Salustro Reydel become the group head of half their
# clients and contaminate the whole chain (the signal cites the CERALP / Bamboo case).

# commissaire among associations and mutual societies. Found by counting the REAL
# capacities in the register (1,101 legal-entity officers across 18 groups, 2026-08-28) —
