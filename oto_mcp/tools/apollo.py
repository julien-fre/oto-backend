"""Apollo.io — B2B prospection (organizations, people, job postings, contacts,
sequences, one-off emails, conversations).

Wraps `oto.tools.apollo.ApolloClient`. Two key regimes depending on what an
endpoint queries, NOT on read/write:

- **Shared Apollo database** (`mixed_companies/search`, `mixed_people/api_search`,
  `people/match`, `organizations/*`): `access.resolve_api_key("apollo")` — user
  key (`/account`) first, otherwise the platform key (free-tier, daily quota =
  `default_quota` per user/day). Any key returns the SAME database (~28M
  companies) → a pooled platform key is safe there. The metered platform quota =
  the **Apollo credits** (`people/match`, which reveals a
  contact); org/people search and job postings consume no credit →
  not metered. ⚠️ **Exhausted quota = NAMED refusal, never a silent fallback**
  (oto-backend#710, signals #311/#312/#313): `resolve_api_key` raises a McpError
  that states the counter (`used/limit`) and that it resets at midnight — and
  `apollo_match_person`, the only debtor of this quota, echoes `platform_quota`
  (`access.platform_quota_hint`, `oto_mcp/access/resolve.py`) in its response
  WHEN the key is the platform key, so that a batch worker can decide BEFORE the refusal
  instead of discovering it in the middle of a lead.
- **The key OWNER's WORKSPACE** (contacts, sequences, emails,
  connected mailboxes, conversations — EVERYTHING added in this module):
  `access.resolve_credential("apollo", want="byo")`, NEVER `resolve_api_key`.
  This is not a read/write distinction — `apollo_email(op="search")` in
  read mode returns `body_html`/`body_text` of the emails SENT BY the key owner;
  `apollo_email_accounts` returns THEIR mailboxes (HTML signature, deliverability
  score). A pooled platform key would expose its owner's private data
  to any other oto user. And for writing
  specifically (enrolling contacts, sending an email): a send on this
  key would also go out from THEIR mailbox, to THEIR contacts — same lock as
  Lightfield `send_email` (oto-core 97c53ce, authorized by the maintainer on
  19/08/2026 under two conditions: the connector only exists if an org sets ITS
  key, and the send goes out from a mailbox that the owner of this key has themselves
  connected — condition #2 carried here by the local lock
  `send_email_from_email_account_id` on the oto-core client side). Conversations
  (transcripts of real calls/video meetings) are byo-only for the same private
  space reason, plus a conditional credit cost (1 if AI insights, 0 otherwise)
  that cannot be metered a priori on the platform quota side. The **contacts** (`apollo_contact`)
  are the clearest case of this rule: a contact is the address book of the
  team that sets the key — hence byo-only on ALL THREE ops, READS INCLUDED,
  even though none costs a credit. Do not confuse them with `people/*`,
  which query the shared database: a person found there is a contact here
  only if the team has saved them.
- **The REVEALS** (`apollo_reveal_phone`, and `apollo_match_person(reveal_personal_emails=True)`):
  byo-only too, but for a THIRD reason — COST, not the data
  boundary. They do query the shared database, so nothing would prevent the
  common key; what prevents it is that the counter (`record_platform_usage`) debits
  1 unit per call, the price of a bare match, whereas Apollo bills a surcharge
  on top (~9 credits for a phone; plan-dependent scale, not measured, for
  personal emails). `platform_quota` would lie by a factor we cannot
  name, and it is the only figure a batch worker stops on.

⚠️ Apollo doc (not verified from this environment, no key available here):
`add_contact_ids` and `/emailer_messages/{id}/activities` (email stats) require
a "Master" key and return 403 otherwise — to be confirmed with a real key.
The same requirement is documented on the THREE contacts endpoints
(`typed_custom_fields`, `contacts/{id}` for reads and PATCH): there, rather than
waiting, `apollo_contact` translates the 403 into a message that NAMES the prerequisite, and
its write remains possible without the catalog (degraded validation, announced).

        apollo_search_people returns hundreds of people with obfuscated last names
        and no email. This is how you resolve them: 10 per call instead of one, so
        300 people cost 30 calls, not 300.

        ⚠️ A LOT DOES NOT SAVE CREDITS — Apollo bills PER PERSON, exactly as if you
        had called apollo_match_person ten times. What it saves is calls, and the
        rate limit that comes with them. Ask only for the reveals you need.

        `matches` comes back one entry PER PERSON, in the order you sent them, with
        `null` where nothing matched. An entry carrying `_stub: true` is an empty
        record Apollo minted and CHARGED for — count it as a failure, not as data.

        Each match drops `employment_history`, the Apollo CRM `account` record and
        the employer's heaviest blocks by default — a lot of 10 overflowed MCP output
        limits. `projection` names them; `full=True` returns everything.

        ⚠️ Phone numbers are not in this response: with `reveal_phone_number` Apollo
        delivers them to oto minutes later and hands back a `request_id` — pass it
        to apollo_reveal_phone_result. Either reveal needs your own Apollo key; a
        plain match works on the shared one.

        Args:
            people: 1-10 entries. Each takes the same identifiers as
                apollo_match_person — `id` (surest, from apollo_search_people),
                `email`, `linkedin_url`, or a FULL name (`first_name` +
                `last_name`) with `domain`/`organization_name`. A weak entry is
                refused by INDEX before the whole lot is billed.
            reveal_personal_emails: also return PERSONAL emails (your own key).
            reveal_phone_number: order phone numbers (your own key); they are
                collected with apollo_reveal_phone_result, not returned here.
            full: return every match untouched (employment history, CRM account,
                employer tech stack). Same price — this is about size.

        the values your team wrote on them. BYO key only, all three ops, and all
        three cost 0 Apollo credits.

        ⚠️ A CONTACT IS NOT A PERSON, AND THE TWO IDS ARE DIFFERENT OBJECTS.
        `apollo_search_people` returns PERSON ids, which every op here REJECTS. Two
        things hand you a real contact id: `apollo_match_person`, nested at
        `person.contact.id` — present once that person is a contact of your
        workspace, and free because you already paid for the match — and op="search"
        below. Never pass a person id: it fails, it does not fall back.

        ⚠️ op="get" IS THE CHEAP WAY TO READ SOMEONE BACK. `apollo_match_person`
        costs a credit and returns the SHARED record — not your team's stage, owner,
        lists or custom values. To re-read a contact you already own, use this.

        ⚠️ CUSTOM FIELDS ARE KEYED BY ID, NEVER BY NAME. `typed_custom_fields` looks
        like `{"60c39ed82bd02f01154c470a": "2026-08-07"}` — call op="fields" FIRST to
        get the ids. Ids are validated against your team's catalogue before the write,
        and an unknown one is refused with the valid ids named.

        ⚠️ FOR A PICKLIST FIELD, THE VALUE IS THE OPTION'S ID, NOT ITS LABEL. op="fields"
        returns `picklist_values` for those — send `picklist_values[].id`. Sending the
        human label is the one mistake Apollo swallows silently.

        ⚠️ A NEW FIELD MEANT TO HOLD A SENTENCE MUST BE `field_type="textarea"`.
        `string` is length-capped (120 characters by default) and Apollo truncates
        past it without complaining — a personalised opener would arrive cut mid-word.

        ⚠️ THE THREE ENDPOINTS NEED AN APOLLO **MASTER** API KEY (or the matching
        scope) and answer 403 otherwise. When op="fields" cannot be read, op="update"
        still writes — but it says so in `field_validation`, it never pretends the ids
        were checked.

        ⚠️ `label_names` REPLACES list membership instead of adding to it — sending
        one list removes the contact from every other. Every other field is a true
        PATCH: what you omit is left untouched.

        Args by op:
        - `fields`: the custom field definitions of your team — `id` (the bare id the
          write expects), `name`, `type`, `modality` and, for picklists,
          `picklist_values`. `modality` filters which object's fields you get
          (default "contact"; "account", "opportunity", or "all" for every object).
          `full=True` returns the raw catalogue instead of the projected one.
        - `create_field`: declare a NEW custom field — the API equivalent of Apollo's
          Settings → Custom Fields, for when you have no access to that UI. `label`
          (required), `field_type` (`string`, `textarea`, `number`, `date`,
          `datetime`, `boolean`), `max_length`, `modality`. Returns the field with its
          id, ready to use as a `typed_custom_fields` key. `dry_run=True` echoes
          without creating. A SETUP gesture — run it once per field, not per lead.
        - `search`: find the contact ids you need. `q_keywords` (name, title,
          employer or email), `contact_stage_ids`, `contact_label_ids`,
          `sort_by_field` (`contact_last_activity_date`,
          `contact_email_last_opened_at`, `contact_email_last_clicked_at`,
          `contact_created_at`, `contact_updated_at`) + `sort_ascending`,
          `per_page` (Apollo caps at 100), `page` (Apollo stops at 500 pages —
          past 50 000 records, filter instead of paging). Searches YOUR saved
          contacts only, never Apollo's database.
        - `get`: `contact_id` (required). Returns the contact and its labels.
        - `update`: `contact_id` (required) + at least one field among
          `typed_custom_fields`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `title`, `email`,
          `organization_name`, `account_id`, `website_url`, `label_names`,
          `contact_stage_id`, `present_raw_address`, `direct_phone`,
          `corporate_phone`, `mobile_phone`, `home_phone`, `other_phone`.
          `dry_run=True` validates the custom field ids and echoes the exact payload
          without writing.

          (`mark_as_finished`, `remove`, or `stop`). Supports `dry_run=True`.
        - `activity`: `contact_id` (required) + optional `sequence_id` filter +
          `per_page` (1-50, most recent events, not pagination). 0 credit, but BYO
          key only — the events are the key owner's OWN sequences.
