"""Procedure — the rendered GRAPH (`oto_procedure_app`): a procedure's drawing, drawn
in the conversation as the partner front's process page draws it. READ-ONLY.

**Per instance, by configuration.** The drawing is optional in the core (18/09/2026: a
partner's rendering need is not a core rule), and its grammar lives in ONE place, the
partner's front (`procedure_diagram.py` refuses a Python twin). So this module draws
nothing itself: its ui:// page is a shell that loads the front's own bundle, and the
tool only ships the drawing. `OTO_PROCEDURE_APP_BUNDLE` (the bundle's URL, e.g.
`https://app.example.com/mcp-app/process-graph.js`, its stylesheet next to it as
`.css`) is both the address and the switch: unset, nothing registers — an instance
without such a front serves no app pointing at nobody. No tenant axis (frozen,
`docs/tenants.md`): one instance, one front.

Not a Prefab card (`docs_app`, `data_review_app`): Prefab renders its own component
tree, and the drawing needs the front's parser and canvas. A plain MCP Apps resource
(SEP-1865), whose CSP admits the bundle's origin and the connector logos.

**Two channels** (cf. `docs_app`, signal #1083): `structuredContent` feeds the view
(the drawing + the connectors it may name, for their logos) and is kept by
`un_seul_canal` because the tool declares `_meta.ui.resourceUri`; the MODEL reads one
line of text pointing at `oto_procedure op=get` for the steps.
