        Use this when you need a tool that does not appear in your tool list. If the

        META/SPINE tools (`oto_*`, `data_*`, `run_*`, `feedback`) are NOT routable

        This bypasses only the DISPLAY filter, never access control: the target's
        call-time gates (connector activation for the org/team the call resolves
        under — refused `connector_disabled` —, credential, connector RBAC, admin
        authz) and the org field-redaction policy apply exactly as for a direct call

        Call-context tokens (ADR 0038) are PREFIXED `_` — `_group`, `_project`,
        `_instance`, `_account`, `_run_id` — and may be included INSIDE `arguments`:
        they route the CALL CONTEXT (which org/team/credential-instance the target
        resolves under), are guarded exactly like on a listed tool, and are stripped
        before the target sees them. E.g. reach a team-scoped connector via
        `arguments={..., "_group": 3}`, or pin an instance via
        `"_instance": "<ref from oto_instance>"`.

        The prefix keeps them out of the tools' own argument space: an unprefixed
        `account`/`org`/`project` in `arguments` is a BUSINESS argument of the target
        (e.g. `aiark_company_search(account=…)` is AI Ark's company filter) and is
        passed through untouched.

                same membership guard as the flat `_org=` axis). Omit for your
                current org.
            _run_id: correlate this call to an open run, exactly like `_run_id` on a
