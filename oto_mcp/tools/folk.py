"""Folk CRM — groups, people, companies, deals, notes, interactions, tasks, webhooks.

Wraps `oto.tools.folk.FolkClient` (public API https://developer.folk.app).
Key resolved per call via `access.resolve_api_key("folk")` — byo-only provider
(user key set on /account, or shared credential of the active org). No
platform key.

**Consolidated surface (ADR 0047 §Amendment, applied to the folk connector)**: one
tool per business OBJECT, the verb as an `op` parameter — 17 tools → 4. What was
merged, and what was NOT (the criterion is parameter homogeneity,
not the count):

- **`folk_record`** (search/get/create/update/delete/add_to_group) — the six
  verbs share the SAME set of parameters (`entity`, `group_id`,
  `object_type`, `id`/`ids`, `dry_run`); only the data carrier changes
  (`filters` for reads, `item`/`items` for creation, `fields` for updates).
  `entity` plays the role that `module` plays at Zoho: person | company | deal |
  note | interaction | task | reminder. The former `folk_list_deals` /
  `folk_list_notes` / `folk_list_reminders` / `folk_get_reminder` fold in WITHOUT
  adding a parameter: they are `op="search"` / `op="get"` on another
  `entity`. `mark_done`/`mark_todo` are the only two ops that apply to
  ONE entity (the task): at Folk, completion is a separate endpoint
  (`POST /tasks/{id}/mark-as-done`), rejected in a PATCH — folding it into
  `op="update"` would have misrepresented what the call does.
- **`folk_group`** (list/create/update/custom_fields/get_custom_field/
  create_custom_field/update_custom_field/members/add_member/remove_member/
  update_member) — stays separate: neither `id`/`ids` (never bulk — a workspace has
  few groups), nor `entity` (`entity_type` qualifies a custom field
  schema, it does not designate an object to write). The `*_member` ops joined
  it by the same homogeneity criterion (anchored on `group_id`, like the
  seven previous ops) rather than a separate `folk_group_member` tool whose
  only required parameter would have been... `group_id`. Folk has **no
  delete endpoint** for a group or a custom field (checked against the
  docs — only list/create/update exist): neither can be removed
  via the API, only from the Folk app — a **member**, however,
  can be removed via the API (`op="remove_member"`).
- **`folk_user`** (list/get) — stays separate: a workspace member is not a CRM
  record (no `entity`, no `group_id`/`object_type`, no writes).
  Its `user_id` parameter reappears on `folk_group` (`*_member` ops) — same
  id space (a group member IS a workspace user), not a naming
  coincidence.
- **`folk_webhook`** (list/create/update) — stays separate: GLOBAL workspace
  resource (no `entity`, no `group_id`/`object_type`, no bulk mode — a
  workspace has few), with its own event vocabulary validated on
  input.

Surface: read/write **per entity** (`op="search"`/`"get"` take
`entity` = person|company|deal[|note|reminder]). `op="create"`/`"update"`/
`"delete"`/`"add_to_group"` also cover note/reminder (and interaction for
create), and are **solo OR bulk depending on the param passed**: a singular
(`item`/`id`) for ONE record → direct result; a plural (`items`/`ids`, ≤50)
for several → lightweight receipt (count + per-item errors, never N full
response bodies). Folk has no batch endpoint anywhere — bulk mode loops over
the single-record methods, in PARALLEL and at a capped rate (`_bulk_run`),
not sequentially with a fixed pause (per-call network latency dominated total
time, not Folk's rate limit).

⚠️ **Two different field vocabularies coexist**: `op="create"` takes
Python snake_case keys (`first_name`, `company_id`...); `op="update"` takes
the raw Folk API field names in camelCase (`jobTitle`,
`customFieldValues`...). Do not transpose one into the other — see the docstring
of `folk_record`. Two words ALSO change meaning between create and update, and
are explicitly rejected rather than returned as an opaque 422: `type` becomes
`activityType` in an interaction PATCH, and `completedAt` (writable at
task creation) is not patchable — use `op="mark_done"`.

**Interactions: reading, not only writing.** The connector long exposed
only `create_interaction`, hence the belief — written in black and white in
this connector's docs — that what had been said with a contact could not be
READ back. That was true of the connector, not of Folk: `GET /interactions/past`,
`/upcoming`, `/{id}` (+ PATCH and DELETE) exist, in open beta. They are
now wired to `op="search"/"get"/"update"/"delete"`. An interaction
is NOT addressable on its own: `entity.id` (the owning person/company) is
required in the query on listing/get/delete — hence the `entity_id` parameter.

**Reminders → tasks.** Folk deprecated `/reminders` on 2026-08-13 (removal
announced for February 2027) in favor of `/tasks`, which does strictly more:
markdown `description`, real filters (due date, assignee, completed or not), and
completion tracking that reminders never had. `entity="reminder"`
keeps working — deprecated is not broken — but nothing new should be
wired to it. What is NOT documented by Folk and remains to be verified:
whether reminders already set show up in `list_tasks` or not.

    the others of that group on the record — silently, with `succeeded: 1` returned.

    **What is provided wins, what is absent survives.** The granularity is the FIELD,

      scheme with API key)";
    - **no side effects** — a GET that returns "The current user associated with
      the API key" (`id`, `fullName`, `email`). It reads the identity the

    - **the cost**: the docs mention NO credit or billing, neither on this

      minute". ⚠️ That is not the same as a line saying "free":
      the absence of a credit counter in the whole doc is a strong argument, not
      proof. If Folk ever introduced per-call billing, this is where
      to come back.

    be spent, only about the pace. Returning it would suggest a gauge.

    **Authenticated ≠ usable** (class named on oto#69, cf. attio/pennylane):

        """Folk CRM records — people (contacts), companies, deals (or any other
        custom object), notes, interactions, tasks, reminders: search, read,
        create, update, delete, add to a group, mark a task done. This is the
        tool for "find/add/update a contact", "look up a company", "list deals",
        "what did we say to X", "what's still open on X" etc. — Folk has no
        separate `folk_company`/`folk_contact`/`folk_deal` tool; `entity` picks
        the noun.

        `entity` scopes every op (person | company | deal | note | interaction |
        task | reminder); `op` picks the verb:

        - **"search"** (default): search records of that entity. Fetches ALL
          matching pages — always pass `filters` on a large workspace. Works on
          every entity, but three of them are addressed by their PARENT record
          rather than by a query: note and reminder take
          `filters={"entity_id": …}`, interaction takes `entity_id` (required)
          + `when`.
        - **"get"**: fetch one record by ID (full record). Every entity except
          note — Folk has NO get-by-id endpoint for notes. `interaction`
          additionally needs `entity_id` (see below).
        - **"create"**: create one (`item`) or several (`items`, ≤50) records.
        - **"update"**: PATCH one (`id`) or several (`items`, ≤50) records —
          only the given fields change.
        - **"delete"**: delete one (`id`) or several (`ids`, ≤50) records.
          Irreversible.
        - **"mark_done"** / **"mark_todo"**: close / reopen one (`id`) or
          several (`ids`, ≤50) **tasks**. `entity="task"` only, and a separate
          op on purpose: Folk refuses `completedAt` in a task PATCH. Nothing in
          Folk ever completes a task on its own — it only moves when something
          calls this.
        - **"add_to_group"**: add one (`id`) or several (`ids`, ≤50) existing
          people/companies to ONE group (`group_id` = the target group). The
          inverse of `op="update"`'s `add_to_groups` (which batches *groups* for
          *one* record) — this batches *records* into *one* group. Reads each
          record's current groups and writes back the union (Folk's `groups`
          field is replace-all on PATCH), so existing group membership is
          preserved. A record already in the group is a no-op success, not an
          error.

        📖 **Reading what actually happened.** `entity="interaction"` is
        readable, not just writable: `op="search"` returns the emails, calendar
        events and manually-logged interactions Folk holds for a person or
        company. (These endpoints are in Folk's **open beta** — the shape may
        still move.) Three things verified live on 2026-08-27, each of which
        changes how you use it:

        - **`op="search"` gives you `content: {subject, snippet}` — NOT the
          body.** The full `body` only comes back from `op="get"` on one
          interaction. So a sweep tells you what was discussed; reading what was
          actually *said* costs one `get` per interaction.
        - **`privacyLevel` withholds the body, not the subject.** On
          `subjectOnly`/`sensitive`/`internal`, `get` still returns subject and
          snippet but `body` is simply absent. The key is BYO, so what comes
          back is what ITS owner may see. A missing `body` is a permission
          outcome, not an empty interaction.
        - **Imported interactions are read-only.** Folk refuses `op="update"`
          and `op="delete"` on anything it pulled in from email, calendar or
          WhatsApp — those belong to their source. Only `interactionType:
          "logged"` records are writable.

        An org-level field-redaction policy, where one is set, can strip fields
        on top of all that.

        ⏳ **Tasks, not reminders — and they are the SAME records.** Folk
        **deprecated** `/reminders` on 2026-08-13 (removal announced for
        February 2027) in favour of `/tasks`. Verified live on 2026-08-27:
        the two are **one store with two views**, not two collections. A
        workspace with 30 reminders has exactly those 30 as tasks, sharing the
        same UUID under a different prefix — `rmd_<uuid>` and `tsk_<uuid>` are
        the same record, and swapping the prefix resolves in both directions.

        So nothing is stranded: a reminder created before the switch is
        readable, filterable and closable as a task today, and `op="mark_done"`
        works on it. Use `entity="task"` for everything new — it does strictly
        more (a markdown `description`, real filters on due date / assignee /
        completion, and completion tracking, which the reminder view has no
        verb for). Field mapping when porting: name→title,
        recurrence_rule→due_at/due_time + recurrence_frequency,
        visibility→is_public.

        The four write ops are **solo OR bulk depending on which param you
        pass**: exactly one of `item`/`items` (create), `id`/`items` (update),
        `id`/`ids` (delete, add_to_group) is required. Solo returns the record
        (or its dry_run preview) directly; bulk returns a receipt (count +
        per-item errors), never N full response bodies.

        ⚠️ **Two different field vocabularies coexist.** `op="create"` field
        names are Python **snake_case** parameter names (`first_name`,
        `company_id`...), forwarded directly to the client — NOT Folk's raw
        camelCase API field vocabulary (`jobTitle`, `customFieldValues`...) that
        `op="update"`'s `fields` uses. An unrecognized create field name raises
        immediately (listing the accepted ones), it is never silently dropped or
        sent under the wrong name. Don't mix the two conventions.

        Per-entity field shape for op="create" (same for `item` and each entry
        of `items`, `*` = required, snake_case — see the warning above):
            person: {first_name*, last_name, emails, phones, job_title,
                company_name, company_id, group_ids, urls, description}
                — ⚠️ Folk ALSO links, on its own, a company matched on the
                person's primary email domain, even when `company_id` is
                passed, and may create one for it — a duplicate of the company
                you named. Read back the person's `companies` after the create
                to see what Folk added.
            company: {name*, emails, industry}
            deal: {name*, people_ids, company_ids, custom_fields}
            note: {entity_id*, content*, visibility}
            interaction: {entity_id*, type*, title*, content, date_time}
                — `date_time` is REQUIRED by Folk even though it reads as
                optional here; omitted, it defaults to now rather than failing
                with an opaque 422 (which is what the connector did until
                2026-08-27).
            task: {entity_id*, title*, due_at*, due_time, description,
                recurrence_frequency, assigned_users, is_public}
            reminder: {entity_id*, name*, recurrence_rule*, visibility}
                — DEPRECATED by Folk, use task.

        `task` field notes: `due_at` is a date "YYYY-MM-DD", `due_time` an
        optional "HH:mm"; `description` is markdown; `recurrence_frequency` ∈
        weekday | weekly | biweekly | monthly | quarterly | yearly;
        `assigned_users` takes user IDs **or** emails (a list of either, or of
        {"id"}/{"email"} dicts) — never both in the same call, Folk rejects a
        mixed list; `is_public` false = visible only to the assignees. Omit
        `assigned_users` and the task lands on the API key's owner.

        Returns, per op —
            search: {"entity", "count", "results"} — plus "when" and
                "truncated" for interactions (and "past_count"/
                "upcoming_count" when when="all").

        Args:
            entity: "person" (a contact), "company", "deal" (or any other
                custom object collection — see `object_type`), "note",
                "interaction", "task" or "reminder" (deprecated — see above) —
                see each op for the ones it accepts (notes have no get-by-id,
                add_to_group is person/company only, mark_done/mark_todo are
                task only).
            op: search (default) | get | create | update | delete |
                add_to_group | mark_done | mark_todo.
            id: the record ID (the deal_id for a deal, tsk_… for a task,
                rmd_… for a reminder) — op="get", and solo mode of
                update/delete/add_to_group/mark_done/mark_todo.
            ids: record IDs — bulk mode of delete/add_to_group/mark_done/
                mark_todo (deal IDs for entity="deal").
            item: op="create" solo — fields for ONE record, see the per-entity
                shape below.
            items: op="create" bulk — fields for MULTIPLE records, same shape as
                `item`, one dict per record. op="update" bulk — one
                `{"id", "fields", "add_to_groups", "remove_from_groups"}` per
                record, same field vocabulary as below.
            fields: op="mark_done" — optionally {"completedAt": "<ISO 8601>"};
                omitted, the task is stamped as completed now. Not accepted by
                op="mark_todo".
                op="update" solo — Folk API field names, camelCase (e.g.
                {"jobTitle": "CTO"}, {"industry": "SaaS"}, or custom fields of a
                deal). Optional if only `add_to_groups`/`remove_from_groups`
                are provided.
                **CUSTOM fields of a person/company** (e.g. a group's Status):
                pass them UNDER `customFieldValues`, keyed by group_id —
                `{"customFieldValues": {"<group_id>": {"Status": "Follow-up"}}}`.
                A custom field passed flat (`{"Status": …}`) is rejected (422
                "Unrecognized key"). The structure can be discovered via op="search"
                (customFieldValues grouped by group_id).
                ✅ **PARTIAL patch: the fields you don't cite are
                KEPT.** The Folk API replaces this object entirely; the tool
                re-reads the record and merges field by field before writing, so
                sending a single field no longer erases the others. To CLEAR a
                field, send it explicitly as `null` or `""` — a provided
                value is written as is. If the record cannot be
                re-read, the call is REFUSED rather than written blindly.
                ⚠️ A custom field may carry a value you NEVER
                sent: folk fills its "AI fields" on its own, a setting
                invisible from the API. ⚠️ This does NOT only happen on entering a
                group — measured on 2026-09-04 on an ordinary `op="update"` that
                sent only two fields: a third came back populated on
                re-read, `null` at the previous read-back. A value read back is
                therefore not proof of what YOU wrote. Re-read the record if the
                value commits you, and never conclude from a read-back that your
                write took effect.
            filters: op="search" — Field → value, matched with `like` (e.g.
                {"fullName": "Dupont", "emails": "@otomata.tech"} for people,
                {"name": "Otomata"} for companies).
                Folk's `like` is a case-insensitive **"contains"**,
                identical on people and companies (measured on 2026-09-07: a fragment
                inside a word, or straddling a space, returns the record).
                ⚠️ **The real trap of a `count=0` is the SCOPE**: the search
                only sees the Folk workspace of the credential resolved for the ACTIVE org —
                a record living in another org's workspace yields `count=0`. Yet `count=0` reads "this
                record doesn't exist" and the next move is a CREATION, hence a
                duplicate: **check the active org (`_org=`) before concluding it is
                absent and creating.** For another operator, pass
                {field: {op: value}} — op ∈ eq, not_eq, like, not_like, empty,
                not_empty, gt (dates), in / not_in (relations).
                **Relations (`groups`, `companies`): the value is the BARE id** —
                `{"groups": "grp_…"}` (= `group_id`), `{"groups": {"not_in":
                "grp_…"}}`, `{"groups": {"in": ["grp_…", "grp_…"]}}`. Do NOT nest
                it as `{"in": {"id": […]}}`: the tool adds the `[id]` of the Folk
                parameter itself, and the nested form is REFUSED. For `note` and
                `reminder`, Folk only has ONE filter: {"entity_id": "<id>"} (the
                person/company/deal the note or reminder hangs off) — or pass
                `entity_id` directly, same thing.
                For `interaction`, Folk exposes NO filter at all: use
                `entity_id` + `when`.
                For `task`, filters are `{field: {operator: value}}` over a
                CLOSED set — dueAt (eq/not_eq/gt/lt), createdAt (gt/lt),
                completedAt (empty/not_empty/gt/lt), assigneeUserId (in/not_in),
                entity (in/not_in). A bare value means `eq` on dueAt and `in` on
                entity/assigneeUserId; the two others demand an explicit
                operator. There is NO `like` here, unlike people/companies — an
                unknown field or operator is refused, naming what exists.
                Open tasks on someone: `entity_id="per_…"` +
                filters={"completedAt": {"empty": True}}. Overdue and still
                open: filters={"dueAt": {"lt": "<today>"},
                "completedAt": {"empty": True}}.
            max_results: op="search" — truncate the response (default 100).
                `count` reports the REAL total, so a `count` above the number of
                `results` means the list was cut. **`entity="interaction"` is
                the exception**: Folk offers no filter there and serves 30 per
                page, and one active contact can hold hundreds (>360 measured
                on a single record), so the search STOPS at `max_results`
                instead of draining the collection — `count` is what came back
                and `truncated: true` says more exists. Ask for a bigger
                `max_results` to go deeper; there is no way to ask Folk for
                "the newest 10" more cheaply than reading one page of 30.
            add_to_groups: op="update" — attach a **person** or **company**
                TO groups (`folk_group` for the IDs), without touching its
                other groups — solo mode only.
            remove_from_groups: op="update" — detach a **person** or
                **company** FROM groups, without touching its other groups —
                solo mode only.
            group_id: the group concerned by the call, meaning set by op/entity —
                op="search" on `person`/`company`: LIST THE MEMBERS of that group
                (get its id from `folk_group`) — e.g. audit the "Leads" pipeline;
                op="add_to_group": the TARGET group the record(s) join;
                REQUIRED for `entity="deal"` on every other op (the group where
                the deal lives — on create, all record(s) land in this one group,
                Folk deals aren't creatable across groups in a single call). Do
                NOT pass it for person/company outside the two cases above.
            entity_id: the PARENT record (person `per_…`, company `com_…`, or
                object `obj_…`) a sub-record hangs off. **Required** for
                entity="interaction" on search/get/update/delete — Folk has no
                "read interaction lit_…" on its own, an interaction is only
                addressable through the record it belongs to (in the query for
                get/delete, in the body for the PATCH). In bulk update each
                item may carry its own. Optional, and
                purely a convenience, on search for note/reminder/task (same as
                filters={"entity_id": …} / filters={"entity": …}). NOT used by
                op="create": there the parent record goes inside `item`.
            when: op="search" on entity="interaction" only — "past" (default:
                what already happened — the one you want for "what did we say
                to X"), "upcoming" (scheduled ahead), or "all" (both, with
                `past_count`/`upcoming_count` in the receipt). ⚠️ The default
                HIDES upcoming interactions: a `count` under "past" is not the
                total Folk holds for that record.
            object_type: custom-object collection name — `deal` only. Omit it:
                the tool auto-discovers this group's real deal object name
                (tries "deals", and on a 404 reads the correct one out of
                Folk's own error, which enumerates this group's valid entity
                types — same discovery `folk_group(op="custom_fields")` uses).
                Pass it explicitly only if the group has MULTIPLE non-person/
                company custom objects (e.g. Deals AND Events AND Projects) —
                auto-discovery can't guess which one is "deal" and will raise
                asking you to disambiguate.
            dry_run: write ops only — writes NOTHING. create: `would_create`
                preview, zero network calls. update / add_to_group: re-reads
                the current state and returns a diff `{"changes": {field: {"from",
                "to"}}}` (solo) or `would_update`/`would_add` (bulk). delete:
                re-reads each record and returns `would_delete` (the current record),
                to check what would be destroyed before doing it. For
                `entity="note"` (no get-by-id on Folk's side), degrades to
                `{"fields": ..., "current_available": False}` (update) or a
                `None` record + `"current_available": False` (delete) — preview
                without the "from". An interaction, on the other hand, always has its
                `entity_id` (all three ops require it), so its diff is
                always real.

        """A Folk group (a folder of people/companies/deals), the custom fields
        defined on it, and its members — list/create/update any of the three.

        `op`:
        - **"list"** (default): list all groups in the Folk workspace.
        - **"create"**: create a group (`name` + `visibility`). A default "All
          people" table view is created automatically by Folk.
        - **"update"**: PATCH a group (`group_id` + `name` and/or `visibility`).
        - **"custom_fields"**: list the custom fields defined on a group for an
          entity type (`group_id` + `entity_type`).
        - **"get_custom_field"**: read one custom field by name (`group_id` +
          `entity_type` + `custom_field_name`).
        - **"create_custom_field"**: create a custom field on a group for an
          entity type (`group_id` + `entity_type` + `custom_field`).
        - **"update_custom_field"**: PATCH a custom field (`group_id` +
          `entity_type` + `custom_field_name` + `fields`).
        - **"members"**: list a group's members (`group_id`) — id, full name,
          email, role. On a **public** group this lists EVERY workspace user
          (Folk auto-membership, role always "admin"), not just people
          explicitly added — see note below.
        - **"add_member"**: add a workspace user to a group (`group_id` +
          `user_id` + `role`). Get `user_id` from `folk_user(op="list")`. A
          no-op on a public group (see note below) — the target is already an
          implicit member.
        - **"remove_member"**: remove a member from a group (`group_id` +
          `user_id`).
        - **"update_member"**: change a member's role (`group_id` + `user_id` +
          `role`).

        Note: Folk has no delete endpoint for a group or a custom field — remove
        either from the Folk app, not from here. A group MEMBER, unlike the
        group itself, can be removed via the API (`op="remove_member"`).

        Note: **`visibility="public"` makes membership implicit and workspace-
        wide** (confirmed live, 2026-08-17) — EVERY workspace user shows up in
        `op="members"` with role "admin", whether or not anyone explicitly
        added them. `op="add_member"`/`"remove_member"`/`"update_member"` only
        do something meaningful on a **private** group (explicit membership).
        To manage membership deliberately, create/update the group with

            entity_type: "person", "company", or a custom object's DISPLAY
                name — required for every custom-field op (default "person").
                Not used by member ops. ⚠️ Only "person"/"company" are fixed.
                Everything else is a **custom object each Folk customer names
                themselves** — "Deals" is just what THIS workspace happens to
                call theirs; another workspace's equivalent could be
                "Opportunities", "Transactions", singular, translated,
                anything. Never assume a name. Discover it: call
                `op="custom_fields"` with any placeholder entity_type — Folk's
                404 names the group's REAL entity types (`"Available entity

            name: op="create"/"update" — group name (1-255 chars).
            visibility: op="create"/"update" — "public" (every workspace user
                is an implicit member, role "admin" — see note above) or
                "private" (only explicitly added members). Required on create.

                (`[{"label", "color"}]`, 1-100), `removeOptions` (option ids,

                only the given ones change.
            user_id: op="add_member"/"remove_member"/"update_member" — the
                workspace user id (from `folk_user(op="list")`, NOT `folk_group
                (op="members")` — a group member IS a workspace user).
            role: op="add_member"/"update_member" — required, one of "admin",
                "contributor", "reader". A LIST can also show "owner" (Folk's
                workspace owner) but it can't be SET through this API.

          subscribes to.
        - **"create"**: create a webhook (`name` + `target_url` +

        Before creating with a filter, call `folk_group` (op="list" for
        `groupId`, op="custom_fields" for the custom field name used in `path`)
        to get real workspace values — don't guess them.

        Note: on create, the response's `signingSecret` is returned in FULL only
        there — Folk only ever shows a redacted version afterwards, so save it
        now if you need to verify payload signatures.

        Note: filters only exist through this API — editing a webhook's events
        from Folk's own settings UI afterwards silently drops them.

            target_url: op="create" — public HTTPS URL that will receive the
                event (max 2048 chars).
            subscribed_events: op="create" — 1-20 items, each
                `{"eventType": ..., "filter": {...}}`.
                eventType — one per entity, by lifecycle:
                  person: created, updated, deleted, groups_updated,
                    workspace_interaction_metadata_updated
                  company: created, updated, deleted, groups_updated
                  object (deals AND any custom object_type): created, updated, deleted
                  note: created, updated, deleted
                  reminder: created, updated, deleted, triggered
                (full values are "person.created", "object.updated", etc.)
                filter (optional, all keys optional):
                  groupId — only for entities in this group (`folk_group`).
                    For object.* this is a sibling of `path`, never repeated
                    inside it.
                  objectType — for object.* events, scope to one collection
                    (e.g. "Deals" vs a custom object_type). Confirmed against a
                    live workspace: this is the exact display name, same as
                    `folk_group`'s `entity_type` — NOT the lowercase slug
                    `folk_record(entity="deal", object_type=...)` historically
                    defaulted to (that tool now auto-discovers it; here, pass
                    the real name yourself).
                  path + value — for *.updated events, fire only when the
                    attribute at `path` changes to `value`. `path` covers both
                    plain attributes and custom fields, and its shape differs
                    by entity:
                      plain attribute (any entity): `["firstName"]`, `["name"]`
                      person/company custom field:
                        `["customFieldValues", groupId, fieldName]` (3 segments
                        — the group id is repeated here, inside the path)
                      object/deal custom field:
                        `["customFieldValues", fieldName]` (2 segments — no
                        group id in path; use the sibling `filter.groupId`
                        instead)
                    fieldName is the field's `name` from
                    `folk_group(op="custom_fields")` (custom fields have no
                    separate id — `name` IS the identifier Folk matches on).
            fields: op="update" — Folk's raw API field names, camelCase — same
                vocabulary caveat as `folk_record(op="update")`: name, targetUrl,
                subscribedEvents (REPLACES the full list, not a merge/add — call
                op="list" first and resend the existing entries you want to
                keep), status ("active"|"inactive" — pause without deleting).
                Same eventType/filter shape as op="create".
            dry_run: if true, writes nothing — op="create" returns a preview
                (`would_create`), zero network calls; op="update" returns a diff
