"""Minari — phone prospecting: transcribed calls, lists, analytics.

Wraps `oto.tools.minari.client.MinariClient` (public v1 API, Bearer). The key
is created in **Settings → API & webhook** and carries the rights of the WHOLE
company — not of a single person. That is why the connector is **byo-only,
with no platform key**: a customer's call log is theirs, and a Minari key
shared across orgs would make no sense (same principle as `stripe`).

**Written from the contract, NOT verified live** (2026-08-31): everything comes from the published OpenAPI
3.1 and the vendor's LLM guide, with no probe against a real account. The
guards below are therefore readings of the contract, to be confirmed with the first
connected account — hence the `_verify` probe, which is the first real test.

**Six tools, one per business object** (ADR 0047), verb in `op=`. No parameter
is silently swallowed: an `op` that does not use a supplied argument REFUSES
(`_refuse_ignored` pattern, silae/granola/stripe).

**Three budgets, because three responses can blow up** — and that is the only
reason this module does more than relay:

1. ⚠️ **The call record embeds the full transcript.** `GET /calls/{id}`
   returns `CallDetail` = all of `CallSummary` PLUS every utterance of a call
   that can last 45 minutes. `op="get"` therefore REMOVES it and replaces it with
   `transcript_utterances` (the count); the text is obtained via `op="transcript"`,
   which is precisely the endpoint Minari split off for this reason. Nothing is
   lost silently: the removed key is named in the response.
2. ⚠️ **A list returns its 1500 contacts in one block**, with no pagination. `op="get"`
   on `minari_list` therefore stops at `max_contacts` (100 by default) and STATES the
   total and the truncation, instead of returning a wall of data.
3. `op="transcript"` caps at `max_utterances` (200 by default) and says so.

⚠️ **The connector's trap no. 1: `minari_list` only sees CSV lists.**
Minari's lists/contacts endpoints cover ONLY the CSV import source;
an account whose contacts come from HubSpot or Salesforce has perfectly real lists that these
endpoints never return. An empty `op="list"` therefore reads as "no CSV
list", NEVER "no list" — and the all-sources view is
`minari_analytics(op="lists")`. The empty response's message says so, because
this is exactly the case where an agent would wrongly conclude the account is empty.

Calls and analytics, on the other hand, cover all sources.

**This module invents nothing**: Minari exposes no call triggering, no
contact editing, no user management. What is missing here is missing from
the API — and the oto-core client does not carry these methods, so adding them
would take an oto-core PR, not a line here.

        Covers ALL sources (CSV imports and CRM-synced contacts alike), unlike
        `minari_list`.

        "get" deliberately OMITS the transcript and reports
        `transcript_utterances` instead — a 45-minute call would otherwise bury
        the summary and objections you asked for. Use "transcript" for the text.

        Search two different ways: `search` matches the contact (name, company,
        phone number); `transcript_search` matches what was SAID. Transcript
        search is a literal substring match, words AND-ed, never semantic and
        never translated — so a French call will not match English terms. Each
        row carries `language`; re-issue in that language (or scope with
        `language="fr"`) to search across locales. Both need 3+ characters.

        "recording" returns availability and size, NOT the audio — an MP3 has no
        useful form in a tool result. For something a human can open, a call
        carries `public_call_link`, a shareable page needing no key — but it is
        null when the company has external call sharing switched off, so check
        it rather than promising someone a link.

                `minari_user`.
            status: "list" only — one or more call statuses. "meeting-booked"
                is a FILTER-only value: it is how you ask for calls that led to
                a meeting, but a returned row never carries it as its `status`
                (rows use the other eight, plus a `meeting_booked` boolean).
            direction: "list" only — omit to get both directions.
            min_duration: "list" only — minimum duration in seconds.
            search: "list" only — contact name, company or phone (3+ chars).
            transcript_search: "list" only — what was said (3+ chars).
            language: "list" only — ISO 639-1 of the AI content, e.g. "fr".
            contact_id: "list" only — filter to one contact.
            list_id: "list" only — filter by list id(s).
            cursor: "list" only — `next_cursor` from a previous response.
                RE-SEND YOUR FILTERS WITH IT: the cursor is a position
                (`started_at` + call id), not a saved query, so a cursor on its
                own pages the whole journal and silently drops your filters.
                Pages are fixed at 50 and cannot be enlarged.
            max_utterances: "transcript" only — cap on returned lines
