"""Attio CRM — full CRUD on records + notes/tasks/lists/entries/comments/meta.

Covers create/read/update/delete on companies, people, deals, and
create/list/delete for notes (the Attio API does not allow editing a note's
body), and create/list/update/delete for tasks (update limited to
`deadline_at`, `is_completed`, `linked_records`, `assignees` on the API side).

Key resolved per call via `access.resolve_api_key("attio")`. Since Attio
has no default quota (see `access._QUOTA_DEFAULTS`), only
admins (with a server `ATTIO_API_KEY`) or users with their own
key set on `/account` can call these tools.

**Consolidated surface (ADR 0047 §Amendment, applied to the attio connector)**: one
tool per business OBJECT, the verb in the `op` parameter — 56 tools → 10. Attio is an
OBJECT-BASED CRM: the `create_X`/`get_X`/`update_X`/`delete_X`/`list_X` pattern was
repeated identically there on a dozen objects, with the SAME parameters each
time. This is the nominal case of the amendment.

- `attio_record` (18 → 1) — companies/people/deals share the SAME resource
  on the client side (`AttioResource`) and therefore the same signature: the object becomes a
  parameter (`object=`), like `module=` at zoho.
- `attio_note` (4 → 1) · `attio_task` (5 → 1) · `attio_list` (5 → 1)
  · `attio_entry` (5 → 1) · `attio_workspace_member` (2 → 1)
  · `attio_meeting` (5 → 1, meeting + its recordings + the transcript: everything
  is keyed by `meeting_id`) · `attio_object` (3 → 1) · `attio_attribute` (4 → 1).
- `attio_comment` (5 → 1) merges comments AND threads: a thread is just the
  string of a comment conversation, both are designated by the SAME
  anchor tuple (`parent_object`+`parent_record_id`, or `list_id`+`entry_id`,
  or `thread_id`) — deleting a head comment deletes the
  thread anyway. Overlapping params ⟹ a single object.

**What was NOT merged**, and why (the criterion is parameter homogeneity,
not the count):
- `attio_entry` stays separate from `attio_list`. The two share `list_id_or_slug`
  and nothing else: list ops work on the CONTAINER (`name`,
  `api_slug`, `workspace_access`), entry ops on its CONTENT (`entry_id`,
  `entry_values`, `parent_record_id`, `filter`, `sorts`,
  `overwrite_multiselect`). Merging would produce a `oneOf` of disjoint
  variants — the schema weight of both tools, plus the ambiguity.
- `attio_note` and `attio_task` stay separate: they only share `content`.
  A note is anchored by `parent_object`/`parent_record_id` + `title`, a task
  by `linked_object`/`linked_record_id` + `deadline`/`assignee_id`, and the API does not
  allow the same verbs (no note update).
- `attio_object` (object definitions) and `attio_attribute` (schema of an object
  OR a list) stay separate: their identifiers do not overlap
  (`object_id_or_slug` vs the `target`+`identifier` pair, where `target` is
  "objects" OR "lists"). Conflating them would make a single `identifier` carry two
  meanings depending on the op.

**What each listing can do, and what it never will** (recorded on
27/08/2026 by differential against the real API, see
`tests/test_attio_listing_window.py` here and in oto-core). Four usage
signals — including #586 and #597, re-reported eleven days later — came from a
daily procedure that did NOT reach the day's call reports:

| object     | pagination                    | sort                  | date window              |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| `note`     | `limit` (def. 10, max 50) + `offset` | **none**       | **none**                 |
| `task`     | `limit` (def. 500, max 1000) + `offset` | `sort`      | **none**                 |
| `meeting`  | `limit` (def. 50, max 200) + `cursor` | `sort`          | `ends_from`/`starts_before` |

⚠️ Attio **SWALLOWS** query parameters it does not know, returning 200
(`/v2/notes` accepts `sort=`, `created_at[gte]` and even `zzz_unknown=x` without
filtering anything). Hence the rule held here: we only expose what upstream
REALLY honors, and a sort or date that does not exist is not simulated on the client
side over a truncated page — that would be a lying filter. Two parameters
were in fact already lying: `attio_task(completed=)` went out as `completed=`
whereas Attio expects `is_completed` (fixed in oto-core, the tool name does not
change), and `attio_meeting(offset=)` was ignored by the API (`offset=2000`
returned the same first page) — replaced by `cursor`, and the old argument is
now REFUSED by naming it rather than accepted with no effect.

⚠️ This module WRITES to a REAL CRM (customer data): `op="create"`/`"update"`/
`"delete"` of `attio_record`, `attio_note`, `attio_task`, `attio_list`,
`attio_entry` and `attio_comment` — and its SCHEMA: `op="create"`/`"create_option"`/
`"create_status"` of `attio_attribute` (oto#256), which the API cannot undo
(no DELETE on an attribute, an option or a stage). The default of EVERY tool is a READ
(`op="list"`, `"query"` or `"threads"`) — a call without `op` can neither write nor
delete. An unknown op is refused BEFORE even resolving the key.

# The agent reads "Erreur interne du serveur.", `retryable: false`, and Sentry opens an
# backend bug issue for a perfectly normal third-party 4xx.

# `uniqueness_conflict`, Attio naming the field ("slug "domains"") AND the record
# already holding the domain. None of that came out; the agent concluded a bug with the
# `.co.uk` public suffix and spent four calls isolating a cause that did not exist.

          workspace. Paginated (`limit` / `offset`).
        - **"get"**: fetch a record by its Attio record ID.

          instead (`[]` empties the field) — the way to free a unique value, a
          domain or an address, before putting it on another record.
        - **"merge"** — ⚠️ WRITES, IRREVERSIBLE: merge `secondary_record_id`
          into `record_id` (same object). Attio marks BOTH as merged — neither
          can be read afterwards — and creates a THIRD record, returned as
          `new_record_id`; where both hold a value, the primary's wins. Not
          idempotent (a replay answers 404). Beta at Attio.

                merge, the PRIMARY record — the one whose values win).
            secondary_record_id: op="merge" — the record merged into `record_id`.
            attributes: op="create"/"update" — Attio attribute dict. Keys are the
                slugs of that object in the workspace; each value follows Attio's
                value format (typically a list, e.g.
                `{"name": [{"value": "Acme"}]}`). On update, same slugs →
                value(s), Attio value format.
                - companies: `name`, `domains`, `description`, `categories`, etc.
                - people: `name`, `email_addresses`, `phone_numbers`, `company`,
                  `job_title`, etc.
                - deals: `name` (str or [{"value": ...}]), `stage` (the TITLE of
                  one of the workspace's deal statuses), `owner`
                  (actor-reference — auto-filled with the first workspace member
                  when omitted), `value`, `associated_company` /
                  `associated_people` ([{"target_object": "companies",
                  "target_record_id": ...}]).

                identifier="<object>", op="list")` and `op="statuses",
                attribute="stage"` — never assume one.
            overwrite_multiselect: op="update" — true = PUT: the multiselect
                values you pass REPLACE the existing ones (`[]` empties them)
                instead of being added.
            query: op="search" — substring of the record NAME.
            filter: op="search" — Attio filter object, `{"<attribute slug>":
