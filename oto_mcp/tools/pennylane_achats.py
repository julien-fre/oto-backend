"""Pennylane PURCHASE invoices — import, read, correct, validate.

Module of the `pennylane` connector (see `Connector.modules` in the registry): same
key, same client, distinct domain — like the general ledger and quotes.

Cycle: `pennylane_upload_file` uploads the PDF, `op="import"` creates the invoice
(with `import_as_incomplete=True`, it arrives as `accounting_status =
validation_needed`), `op="update"` corrects it (label, dates, amounts, and the
`vat_rate` of its LINES), `op="validate"` moves it to `complete`.

**Validation is a COMMITTING accounting entry**: never implicit,
never inside an import, and the API does not expose the reverse action.

        """PURCHASE invoices (supplier invoices received) — the "expenses" side.

        `op`:
        - "list": the inventory of received invoices, to be checked against disbursements
          (bank reconciliation) or to spot what remains to be paid. ⚠️ Without
          `max_pages`, the WHOLE history comes back — start small.
        - "get" (`invoice_id`): the invoice, including `accounting_status` (draft |
          archived | entry | validation_needed | complete).
        - "lines" (`invoice_id`): its lines, with their `id` and their `vat_rate` —
          the `id`s to pass to `op="update"`.
        - "import": creates the invoice from an already posted PDF
          (`pennylane_upload_file` → `file_attachment_id`). Pennylane does NOT do
          OCR: YOU (having read the PDF) supply the fields, amounts as STRINGs.
          The excl.-VAT amount (`currency_amount_before_tax`) is required at INVOICE level and
          REFUSED inside a line: a line only carries `currency_amount` (incl. VAT)
          and `currency_tax`, plus its `vat_rate`. `import_as_incomplete=True` leaves it
          in `validation_needed`.
        - "update" (`invoice_id`): corrects an invoice not yet validated — the
          invoice fields provided (`label`, `date`, `deadline`,
          `invoice_number`, `supplier_id`, amounts, `external_reference`,
          `currency`) and the lines, via `invoice_lines` = an OBJECT
          `{"update": [{"id": …, "vat_rate": …}], "create": [...], "delete":
          [{"id": …}]}` (not a list here). The reference documents no
          refusal on an already `complete` invoice: if Pennylane refuses, the refusal
          is surfaced as is.
        - "validate" (`invoice_id`): moves the invoice to `complete` — the accounting
          entry is posted. ⚠️ COMMITTING action with no way back through the API: only
          call it on explicit user request, invoice by
          invoice, never right after an import. 422 refusal if the entry
          lines are not balanced.

        A line's `vat_rate` = Pennylane code: 20 %→"FR_200", 10 %→"FR_100",
        5.5 %→"FR_55", exempt→"exempt". REVERSE-CHARGE codes of the v2
        reference: `intracom_21`, `intracom_55`, `intracom_85`, `intracom_100`,
        `extracom`, `crossborder`, `FR_85_construction`, `FR_100_construction`,
        `FR_200_construction`. The reference does not define them beyond their name
        and knows NO `intracom_200`: for an intra-EU acquisition at 20 %,
        ask the user for the right code (accounting question), do not guess.

        Several Pennylane instances in an org (personal and company): without
        `_instance`, the personal key answers first. For the company's
        purchases, pass `_instance="org:<id>:pennylane"`.

        Args:
            op: "list" (default) | "get" | "lines" | "import" | "update" | "validate".
            invoice_id: required for get / lines / update / validate.
            max_pages: op="list" / "lines" — bounds the pagination.
            file_attachment_id: op="import" — id returned by `pennylane_upload_file`.
            supplier_id: op="import" (required) / "update" — existing supplier
                (`pennylane_supplier`).
            date / deadline: op="import" (required) / "update" — ISO dates (invoice /
                due date).
            currency_amount_before_tax / currency_amount / currency_tax:
                op="import" (required) / "update" — excl. VAT / incl. VAT / VAT of the INVOICE, as
                STRING.
            invoice_lines: op="import" — LIST of ≥1 line (`currency_amount`,
                `currency_tax`, `vat_rate`, and `ledger_account_id` if needed);
                op="update" — OBJECT {create|update|delete}.
            currency: default EUR on import; on update, only to change it.
            external_reference: idempotency / trace key.
            import_as_incomplete: op="import" — leaves the invoice in
                `validation_needed`.
            invoice_number / label: supplier number / accounting label.
