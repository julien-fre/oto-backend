"""Lemlist — push a table's rows as leads, BY REFERENCE.

Third module of the connector (`lemlist` holds the campaign, `lemlist_crm` the rest):
this one carries a single action, `lemlist_push_rows`. `lemlist_create_lead` took the
person as ARGUMENTS — name, email, phone went through the tool call, once per
lead. Here the agent designates rows; the server reads them, creates the leads, writes
back the lemlist id and the state on each row, and only returns counts. The shared
mechanics (batch, lease, write-back, receipt) live in `datastore/par_reference.py`.

⚠️ Like `lemlist_create_lead`, this action SENDS nothing: a created lead waits for the
campaign's review. What puts a message on the wire remains `lemlist_launch_lead` and
`lemlist_campaign_start`, hidden by default (see `tools/lemlist.py`).

        """Create lemlist leads FROM DATASTORE ROWS — the bulk way; nothing personal
        goes through this call.

        Name the rows (`row_ids`, or a `filter`); oto reads them, creates one lead per
        row in the campaign, and writes back `id_column` (the lead id) and
        `status_column` (pushed | duplicate | failed) on each row. The answer is
        counts plus `errors: [{row_id, code}]` — never a value read from a row.

        By `filter`, only rows whose `status_column` is empty are taken: call again
        with the same filter until `remaining` is 0. A row already treated is not
        picked again — name it in `row_ids` to retry it. A row with `id_column`
        already set is skipped (`already_pushed`); one reserved by another run is
        skipped (`row_locked`) before anything is sent. `dry_run` reads and checks
        the mapping, sends nothing. Like lemlist_create_lead, this sends no email: a
        lead waits for review until lemlist_launch_lead.

        Args:
            datastore: the table, by name or number.
            campaign_id: lemlist campaign id WITH its `cam_` prefix.
            field_mapping: {lead field: column}. Lead fields are those of
                lemlist_create_lead (email, first_name, last_name, company_name,
                job_title, linkedin_url, phone, company_domain, icebreaker, timezone,
                contact_owner); any other key becomes a custom variable. A row needs
                an email, a linkedin_url or a phone.
            row_ids: the rows to push (at most 50). Exclusive with `filter`.
            filter: data_rows filter grammar; `{}` = every row not yet treated.
            deduplicate: skip a lead whose email is already in another campaign.
            id_column: where the lemlist lead id is written back.
            status_column: where pushed | duplicate | failed is written back; the
                code of a duplicate or a failure goes in its `comment` layer.
            batch_size: rows per call with `filter` (1-50).
            dry_run: read and check only — no lemlist call, nothing written.
