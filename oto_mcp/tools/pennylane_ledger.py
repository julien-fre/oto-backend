"""Pennylane general ledger — read entries, post some, letter lines.

Second module of the `pennylane` connector (see `Connector.modules` in the registry):
same key, same client, distinct domain. Journals, for their part, are reference data
and are read through `pennylane_ref(kind="journals")`, with the others.

⚠️ **This is not the GED (document management).** The `pennylaneged` connector targets the same company
through another door (the interface's private API, browser session), and its
`company_id`s are NOT the ones here. An id taken from one and played in the other
returns a refusal that mimics an expired session.

⚠️ **Three scopes, not one.** Pennylane split the old `ledger` scope: reading
entries requires `ledger_entries:*`, journals `journals:*`, the chart
of accounts `ledger_accounts:*`. A key that reads one does not necessarily read the
others, and the scope is specific to whoever created the key. The real permissions are
read with `pennylane_ref(kind="company")`, `scopes` field.

        """General-ledger entries: read, post an entry, correct it.

        ⚠️ **`op="create"` has NO draft, and the action is irreversible.**
        Everywhere else in this connector, a committing entry is posted as a
        draft then finalized in a second action, after human
        validation. Pennylane does not offer this step for an accounting entry:
        it is posted immediately, and the API cannot delete it — the
        only recourse is `op="update"`, which can itself destroy lines.
        **Announce the exact detail to the user — journal, date, label, and
        each line with its account and amount — and wait for their agreement
        BEFORE calling.**

        ⚠️ **`op="list"` without `clauses` brings back the WHOLE history** — on a
        real accounting system, thousands of entries, well beyond the token
        limit. Filtering at the source is the only way to find an
        entry; `max_pages` limits the damage but targets nothing.

        Args:
            op: "list" — the entries, to be filtered with `clauses`;
                "get" — ONE entry by its `entry_id`;
                "lines" — the lines of an entry, with their `id` (this is the
                    id that lettering consumes, not the entry's);
                "lettered" — the lines lettered WITH the line `line_id`, to
                    see what a lettering actually associated.
            entry_id: entry id — required by "get" and "lines".
            line_id: id of an entry LINE — required by "lettered".
            clauses: server-side filter, list of `{"field", "operator", "value"}`.
                Filterable fields: `id`, `date`, `journal_id`. Operators:
                `lt`, `lteq`, `gt`, `gteq`, `eq`, `not_eq`, plus `in` and
                `not_in` on `id` and `journal_id`. Example:
                `[{"field": "date", "operator": "gteq", "value": "2026-01-01"}]`.
            max_pages: bounds the number of pages fetched.
            date: op="create" — entry date (YYYY-MM-DD).
            label: op="create" — entry label.
            journal_id: op="create" — the journal in which to post the entry. Resolve it
                with `pennylane_ref(kind="journals")`: these ids are specific to
                the company, never to be hard-coded.
            lines: op="create" — the lines, 1 to 1000. Each `{"debit": "…",
                "credit": "…", "ledger_account_id": …}` and an optional `label`.
                Amounts are decimal STRINGS ("120.50"), and
                debits must equal credits — otherwise the call is refused
                before reaching Pennylane, with the figure of the gap. Accounts
                are resolved with `pennylane_ref(kind="ledger_accounts")`.
            due_date / currency / piece_number: op="create", optional
                (EUR currency by default, auto-generated document number).
            fields: op="update" — the fields to modify on the entry.
                ⚠️ `ledger_entry_lines` takes `create`/`update`/`delete` there: this
                action can DELETE lines: it commits as much as a
                creation, and is announced in the same way.
