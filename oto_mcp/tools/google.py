"""The Google account — the carrier that the services (gmail, drive, sheets, calendar,
tasks, chat since the 2026-09-26 split; bigquery since 2026-10-02) borrow.

A single, read-only tool: `google_accounts` — the connected accounts and, for
each, the services it has AUTHORISED. This is the question that did not exist before the
split (one consent = the six scopes) and that each service now raises:
`drive_file` on an account that only authorised Gmail is refused, naming the card
to open. `gmail_list_accounts` stays (compat with written procedures); this is where
"which accounts, with which rights?" is now asked — accounts SHARED by
the team or org included, since a call can name them in `account`.
