            `model` names the exact snapshot that answered — store it next to the
            answer, it is what makes a threshold reproducible.
            `usage` carries `input_tokens`, `output_tokens` (free) and `cost` in USD.

        A probability near 0.5 means "as likely as not", never "medium": pick two

        """Qualify a table's rows with Jev ON THE SERVER: rows are read, judged and written
        back here, and no row data passes through you. Write the rubric; review the sample.

        Each row's `state_fields` are sent with the same `questions`; each answer is written
        to its `output` column, its confidence to `<column>_p` (choice and score), and the
        model snapshot to `model_column`. A `noul` writes its probability; a score writes
        the expected level (e.g. 3.34). A row Jev can never answer as is (state too large,
        or refused upstream as too long) or whose answer the table refuses to store gets
        `jev_error: <reason>` in `model_column`. A row whose state fields are all empty is
        counted in `empty_state` and left undecided: fill it, then re-run.
        Missing output, `<column>_p` and `model_column` columns are created, typed from
        the questions (choice → enum of its criteria); existing ones are never changed.
        The key and the rubric are checked before anything is created or written.

        Only undecided rows are taken (`model_column` empty) unless `overwrite=true`, so a
        re-run resumes and never pays twice. Rows leased by another run are skipped, and a
        row changed since it was read is never overwritten.

        A whole table: `background=true` (after a dry run). The call returns a `job_id`
        at once and the server judges every matching row itself — no cursor loop, and a
        dropped connection doesn't stop it. Follow it with `jev_job(op='status')`, stop
        it with `jev_job(op='cancel')`. The key, the write right and the quota are
        checked again before every slice: a revoked key or a spent quota stops the job,
        and what was already judged stays written and billed. One active job per table
        and `model_column`. A job keeps `_run_id` and bills its slices under it.

        Without `background`, one call judges what fits in its time window (~100 rows):
        loop on `next_cursor` until `done`, then finish with one pass WITHOUT cursor to
        pick up skipped rows. Nothing reserves rows between two calls: do not run two at
        once on the same rows.

        Any other upstream refusal (key, credits, a malformed request) stops the batch:
        what was already judged stays written and billed, and the error says how much.

        Run `dry_run=true` on known cases before a full run. Jev sees only the state and the
        questions: put client context (ICP, offer) in the criteria or the state. Rows with a
        thin state score low for lack of evidence (`thin_state` counts them). No bucketing
        here: thresholds belong to you.
        Validate fit against known outcomes before trusting it; combine Jev's answers with
        structured fields in plain code.

        ⚠️ Each state goes to a third party (OpenRouter, then TypeSafe). Billed on real cost,
        about 50 µ$ per row for 3 questions and a 500-character description.

        Returns — `{decided, jev_errors, empty_state, skipped_leased, skipped_changed,
        errors, error_count, low_confidence, thin_state, created_columns, next_cursor,
        remaining, done, cost, model, sample}`. `errors` and `sample` name rows by `_id`
        with codes and what was written — never a value read from the table. `dry_run`
        returns `rows` (each judged row's `_id` and answers) and `would_create_columns`,
        and writes nothing. `background` returns `{job_id, status, remaining,
        created_columns}`.

        Args:
            datastore: the table number (ns_id) or `slot:<name>`.
            questions: the rubric, same shape and rules as `jev_ask`; `criteria` required.
            state_fields: columns to send, each a name or `{name: max_chars}`.
            output: `{question: column}`; choice → text/enum, score and noul → number.
                Missing columns are created.
            model_column: text column for the model snapshot or `jev_error`; required
                (created if missing).
            filter: `data_rows` filter grammar.
            filters: `data_rows` multi-column clauses.
            limit: max rows judged in this call (default and max 500; dry run max 20).
                Ignored with `background`: the job takes every matching row.
            parallel: rows in flight (default 25, max 50).
            dry_run: judge and return, write nothing (still billed).
            overwrite: also re-judge rows that already have an answer.
            cursor: `next_cursor` from the previous call (not with `background`).
            model: another model id (default: the pinned dated snapshot).
            background: run the whole table as a server job; returns a `job_id`.
