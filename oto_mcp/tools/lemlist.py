"""Lemlist — campaigns, sequences, schedules, leads, stats and enrichment.

First of the TWO modules of the connector: this one holds the CAMPAIGN and its
leads, `lemlist_crm.py` holds everything else (CRM, inbox, unsubscribes, watch
lists, tasks, shared base, team, mailboxes, lemwarm, deliverability,
webhooks). Together they cover lemlist's 141 documented routes, without
exception — and two inventories prove it rather than assert it:
`test_lemlist_coverage.py` on the oto-core side (every route has a path in the
client), `test_lemlist_surface_coverage.py` here (every client capability is
called by a tool, the few exceptions being named with their reason).

The connector knew how to READ a campaign and drop leads into it; it did not know
how to run one. `lemlist_campaign`, `lemlist_campaign_start`,
`lemlist_sequence`, `lemlist_schedule` and `lemlist_lead` close that gap: create
and configure a campaign, write its sequence step by step, hold its sending
windows, validate it, start it, pause it, duplicate it, measure it,
export it, and carry its leads end to end.

The bound has not disappeared, it has MOVED to where it really bites: on what
puts messages on the wire, not on writing in general. FOUR tools do so
or arm it, and all four are hidden by default
(`DEFAULT_HIDDEN_TOOLS`, self-activatable): `lemlist_campaign_start` (lemlist
runs the sequence for all launched leads), `lemlist_launch_lead` (a lead
leaves review), `lemlist_inbox_send` (the three direct sends, with no campaign
or review in front of them) and `lemlist_campaign_auto_review`. Everything else — create,
configure, duplicate, pause, schedule, tidy the CRM — works on a DRAFT
or on data, and sends nothing.

That grain is what dictated the split: `DEFAULT_HIDDEN_TOOLS` has the grain of the
TOOL, not of the `op`. `start` as `lemlist_campaign(op="start")` would have gone into
a visible tool and silently unhinged the bound — hence a bare tool for it
alone, and likewise for the inbox sends.

Corollary, and it is the least obvious point of the module: `autoReview` /
`autoReviewConditions` do NOT go through `lemlist_campaign`'s settings dict.
The field is not removed from the connector for all that — it has its
own hidden tool, `lemlist_campaign_auto_review`. The reason: this setting
launches any lead as soon as it is added, so it would turn `lemlist_create_lead` — visible,
and visible BECAUSE it sends nothing — into a send path, without any hidden
tool being called. The field remains reachable; it is the ACTION that becomes
explicit.

Enrichment (`lemlist_enrich`, `lemlist_enrich_lead`) sends nothing — but
it SPENDS lemlist credits on every action. Hence the same bound, taken
differently: no action by default, a call with no action requested fails here
(INVALID_PARAMS) rather than going to fetch lemlist's documented 400.

Async surface, like FullEnrich (signal #252): the POST returns an `enrichment_id`
in ~1s and the work continues on the lemlist side. Polling belongs to the agent —
`lemlist_enrich_result` reads a status and hands control back. Never an in-process
wait loop: every MCP client hangs up around 60s, and the result
would be lost WHILE the credits are consumed.

Key resolved per call via `access.resolve_api_key("lemlist")`. No default
platform quota — each user sees THEIR OWN campaigns,
so a user key is required.

        """Create a lead in a campaign.

        Several leads: lemlist_push_rows reads them from a datastore table instead.

        All lead fields are optional (lemlist accepts phone/LinkedIn-only
        leads), but you'll usually pass at least `email` or `linkedin_url`.
        `custom_variables` merges extra key-value pairs into the lead, used for
        campaign personalization (e.g. `{{variableName}}` in a template).

        Enrichment flags (all default False, each may cost lemlist credits):
        `deduplicate` skips the insert if the email already exists in another
        campaign, `linkedin_enrichment` runs LinkedIn enrichment,
        `find_email`/`verify_email` find or verify the email, `find_phone`
        finds a phone number.

        `campaign_id` is lemlist's campaign id as it returns it, WITH its `cam_`
        prefix (`cam_A1B2C3…`) — an id without it is refused before any call.

        Returns the created lead, including `_id` — pass it to
        `lemlist_launch_lead`/`lemlist_add_lead_variables`. A response without a
        lead `_id` is a named refusal (`lemlist_lead_not_created`), never a
        success. `review_state` is always `"unknown"`: lemlist's answer does not
        say whether the lead is held for review or already in sequence (its
        `isPaused` does not tell them apart, so it is removed). To know if it
        will send, read `lemlist_campaign(op="reports")`: `reviewedCount` or
        `inSequenceLeadCount` rising with the add means it goes out; only
        `totalCount` rising means it is held for review until
        `lemlist_launch_lead`.
        A 404 « Campaign not found » is a named refusal
        (`lemlist_campaign_not_found`): the campaign is not reachable by the key
        in use for leads, even if its reports are.

        A lead lemlist refuses as a DUPLICATE is not an error: the call returns
        `{created: false, reason, message, campaign_id, lead}` with `reason`
        `already_in_other_campaign` or `already_in_campaign` — nothing was
        created; count the contact as already taken and move on.

        Nothing here sends: a created or duplicated campaign lands in DRAFT.
        Putting messages on the wire is `lemlist_campaign_start` (hidden by
        default — enable it with `oto_enable_tool lemlist_campaign_start`).

        Args by op:
        - `create`: `name` (required), optional `timezone` (IANA, drives the
          auto-created schedule; server default `Europe/Paris`). Returns the
          campaign with `sequenceId` and `scheduleIds` — the two ids
          `lemlist_sequence` and `lemlist_schedule` need. `settings` is REFUSED
          here (the endpoint takes name + timezone only) — chain `update` on
          the returned id rather than believe a setting landed.
          ⚠️ The campaign is created in state RUNNING, not draft (its `status`
          reads "draft" only because it has no step and no lead yet). It sends
          nothing while the review gate holds, but chain `op="pause"` if you
          want to build it with the switch off.
        - `update`: `campaign_id` + `name`, `sender_user_ids` (`usr_…`, the
          senders) and/or `settings` (raw PATCH body: `stopOnEmailReplied`,
          `stopOnMeetingBooked`, `stopOnLinkClicked`, `disableTrackOpen`,
          `disableTrackClick`, `disableTrackReply`, `tracking`, `onReplied`,
          `aiFeatures`…). Only the keys sent change.
        - `pause`: `campaign_id`. THE off switch — a campaign created here is
          already running. Stops it advancing; already-scheduled leads are NOT
          recalled. Errors if the campaign is not running.
        - `duplicate`: `campaign_id` + optional `name`. Copies sequence, steps,
          schedules and AI templates into a fresh DRAFT (CRM settings excluded).
        - `statutes`: `campaign_id`. The validation the lemlist UI runs — read it
          BEFORE starting: `level` 3 blocks the launch (no sender, broken DNS),
          2 warns (daily limit, missing schedule), 1 informs.
        - `reports`: `campaign_ids`. One row per campaign in operator vocabulary
          (`emailsSent`, `emailsOpened`, `emailsReplied`, `senderNames`, `state`)
          — the shape for comparing campaigns.
        - `batch_stats`: `campaign_ids` (≤ 100) + optional `start_date`/`end_date`
          (defaults to the whole life), `channels` (`email`/`linkedin`/`others`),
          `send_user` (`usr_…|sender@email`), `ab_selected` (`A`/`B`).
          Same counters as `lemlist_get_campaign_stats`, in one call.

        - `export_start`: `campaign_id`. Opens an ASYNCHRONOUS stats export and
          returns its id; poll `export_status` (`campaign_id` + `export_id`),
          or ask to be notified with `export_email` (+ `email`).
        - `export_leads`: `campaign_id` + optional `state` (defaults to `all`;
          lemlist's own default filters EVERYTHING out and returns an empty
          list that reads as "no leads"), `format` (`csv`, the API default, or
          `json`). Returns the leads directly — the synchronous cousin of the
          export above.

        `autoReview`/`autoReviewConditions` are not settable here: they make
        every added lead send immediately, which would turn `lemlist_create_lead`
        into a send path. They live in `lemlist_campaign_auto_review`, hidden by
        default — a switch that arms sending should take a deliberate gesture,
        not ride along in a settings dict.

        auto-creates one and returns its id in `scheduleIds`.

        Args by op:
        - `list`: optional `limit`, `offset`/`page`, `newest_first` — the
          route is paginated, so a team with many windows needs them.
        - `get` / `delete`: `schedule_id`.
        - `create`: `name` (required) + `timezone` (IANA, default
          `Europe/Paris`), `start`/`end` (`HH:mm`, default 09:00-18:00),
          `weekdays` (1 = Monday … 7 = Sunday, default Mon-Fri),
          `seconds_to_wait` (pacing between two sends), `public` (offer it as a
          team template).
        - `update`: `schedule_id` + any of the same fields; only what is sent
          changes.
        - `for_campaign`: `campaign_id`. The schedules attached to a campaign.
        - `associate`: `campaign_id` + `schedule_id`. Attaches an existing
          window to a campaign.

        `oto_guide op=read slug="lemlist-playbook"`: build order, where each id comes from, and the doc↔API gaps.

        A LEAD is a person's copy inside ONE campaign (its sending state, its
        variables); the person themself is a contact (`lemlist_contact`).
        Creating a lead is `lemlist_create_lead`; releasing one held for review
        is `lemlist_launch_lead`.

        - `get`: `lead_id` or `email`. `list`: `campaign_id` + optional `state`
          (`sent`, `replied`, `paused`…) and `limit`. ⚠️ `state` defaults to
          `"all"` HERE, which is NOT lemlist's own default: without it the API
          filters everything out and returns an empty list that reads as "no
          leads on this campaign". Pass a state only to narrow deliberately.
        - `update`: `campaign_id` + `lead_id` + `fields` (`firstName`,
          `lastName`, `companyName`, `jobTitle`, `preferredContactMethod`).
        - `delete`: `campaign_id` + `lead_id`/`email` — really removes it.
          `unsubscribe`: same arguments, but the lead STAYS on the campaign,
          marked unsubscribed. One lemlist route serves both, and its default is
          the soft one; here the two are named apart so neither is a surprise.
        - `pause`: `lead_id`; WITHOUT `campaign_id` it pauses the lead in EVERY
          campaign, not one. `resume`: `lead_id` — undoes a pause, so lemlist
          starts sending to that lead again (it does not skip a review; that is
          `lemlist_launch_lead`).
        - `interested` / `not_interested`: `lead_id` or `email`; with
          `campaign_id` it applies to that campaign, without it to all.
        - `vars_update`: `lead_id` + `variables`. `vars_delete`: `lead_id` +
          `variable_names` (the values are erased).
        - `import_crm`: `campaign_id` + `crm` + `user_id` + `filter_id`
          (from `lemlist_team(op="crm_filters")`), optional `filter_type`,
          `deduplicate`.
