"""Email — send a free-content message (written by the agent), per-org.

The sender address belongs to an **email connector** of the org (config keyed
per connector in `orgs.email_settings`); the **transport derives from it**
(`providers.EMAIL_CONNECTOR_TRANSPORT`):
- connector **`scaleway`** → transport `mailer`: Otomata service `mailer.oto.zone`
  (Scaleway TEM). Domain verified on the TEM side **and** in the `MAILER_FROM_DOMAINS` allowlist.
  The sending key remains Otomata's (no org key).
- connector **`resend`** → transport `resend`: BYOK, direct call to the Resend API
  with the **org's Resend key** (vault, `access.resolve_api_key("resend")`). Domain
  verified on the Resend side by the org.

**Dynamic** authorization depending on the resolved `from`:
- sending from a declared address of the org → **org member** is enough;
- **brand** fallback = the instance's sender (`OTO_MAIL_FROM`; org with no configured address, `from` omitted) →
  reserved to **super_admin** (it is the platform's brand identity).

To be distinguished from `gmail_compose`, which writes from the user's Gmail mailbox
(and which drafts a DRAFT by default — sending there is explicit).

Spine: loaded explicitly in `register_all`, outside the activation gate, hidden
by default (`PROTECTED_TOOLS`/`DEFAULT_HIDDEN_TOOLS` on the visibility side).

        rendered in the brand template, with an optional button and ONE header image. Can be
        SCHEDULED.

        The org declares its sender addresses (`oto_org_settings domain=email`);
        each one sends either via the Otomata mailer (domain verified on the TEM side), or
        via the org's Resend key. Typical use — onboarding sequences driven
        by the agent: read the target account's state, write a TAILORED message, send,
        then record it in the datastore so as not to follow up twice. To send
        from the user's Gmail mailbox, use `gmail_compose` — note that it
        drafts a DRAFT by default, you need `mode="send"` for it to go out.

        Scheduled send: by default the org has a "quiet hours" window (e.g. 8pm–8am);
        if you compose inside it, the send is AUTO-shifted to the next open slot —
        you have nothing to compute. Leave `send_at` empty in that case. For a
        specific time, pass `send_at`. To force an immediate send despite the quiet
        hours, `force_now=True`. Manage/cancel the queue: `oto_scheduled_emails(op='list'|'cancel')`.

        Footer: a send with your org's key (Resend, Scaleway TEM) carries the
        PLATFORM's footer, unless the org has declared ITS unsubscribe on this
        connector — `oto_org_settings(domain='email', op='set', connector=…,
        footer={"unsubscribe_url": "https://…"} or {"unsubscribe_email": "…"})`,
        org_admin: its footer then replaces ours. Nothing removes it from this
        tool. A send under the platform address always keeps ours. The `footer`
        field of the response says which one goes out (`org` | `platform`). The
        footer's language is the brand's declared language, not your body's.

        Header image: `image_url` (https) + `image_alt` REQUIRED; the public URL
        comes from `oto_upload_url(target="image")` (an upload, reusable).

        Returns {sent, to, cc, subject, from, transport, footer} on an immediate send;
        {scheduled, id, scheduled_at, ...} if scheduled; +`html` if dry_run.

        Args:
            to: recipient's email address.
            cc: visible copy addresses (list, max 10), `name@domain.tld` with no display
                name. No hidden copy. Under the platform address, `to` +
                `cc` count toward a daily cap of recipients per org.
            subject: subject line (oto funnel voice: lowercase, formal "vous" address).
            body: plain-text body. Blank lines separate paragraphs;
                single line breaks are kept. HTML is escaped
                (don't inject tags). Write real, personalized content —
                never invent anything about the recipient's account.
            from_email: sender address. MUST be a declared address of the active
                org. Omitted = the org's default address (or the platform's
                address if the org has none — super_admin only).
            cta_text: label of an optional action button (e.g. "open oto").
            cta_url: URL of the button (required if `cta_text` is provided).
            image_url: public `https://` URL of ONE image at the top of the mail (480 px,
                scaled down on mobile). To publish it: `oto_upload_url(target="image")`
                → PUT the file → the receipt returns `url` (permanent, reusable).
            image_alt: replacement text, REQUIRED with `image_url` — many
                clients block images, the mail must keep its meaning without it.
            reply_to: reply address (default = the sender's, otherwise the studio's
                mailbox).
            send_at: desired send time (ISO 8601, e.g. "2026-06-24T08:00").
                Without a timezone = the org's timezone. In the past = schedules at that time.
            force_now: send right away even within the quiet hours window.
            dry_run: if true, RENDERS the HTML without sending — to proofread before sending.
