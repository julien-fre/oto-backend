"""Mailpool tools — cold-email infrastructure: domains, DNS, mailboxes, spam
checks, warmup.

Wraps `oto.tools.mailpool.client.MailpoolClient` (API v1, `X-Api-Authorization`).
Five tools, one per business object:

- `mailpool_domains` — list, read, DNS records, deliverability audit,
  availability and suggestions for a new name, saved owners;
- `mailpool_domain_fix` — the only tool that edits DNS: SPF hard fail, DMARC
  report address, tracking CNAME, single records. `dry_run=True` by default,
  with a real diff;
- `mailpool_mailboxes` — list, read;
- `mailpool_spam_checks` — run (free), read, list, delete;
- `mailpool_account` — subscription slots, warmup.

⚠️ **No credential ever reaches the caller.** Three layers: the client strips
every credential key, `_run` scrubs every result again, and mailboxes are
served through the client's ALLOWLIST (`project_mailbox`, its domain reduced to
id/name/type), spam checks without their embedded mailbox, warmup inboxes and
registrant owners through allowlists of their own (an owner's name, address and
phone are not served) — a field Mailpool adds tomorrow is not served until it
is listed.

⚠️ **Nothing billed is served**: registering, transferring or renewing a domain,
creating a mailbox, changing slots, enrolling in warmup, inbox placement.

DNS behaviour (observed live on 2026-10-05, encoded in `mailpool_dns`): a DNS
write REPLACES the whole record set — the fix tool reads, plans, and hands the
full set to `update_domain_dns(…, expected=<the read>)`, which refuses it if the
set changed since, refuses to strip a host of its MX/SPF/DKIM, reads back and
restores the previous set if anything went missing. What stays HERE is the
business guard: no plan may add an audit error (`mailpool_dns`). The `_dmarc`
record only goes live through the DMARC-email call, which also writes `ruf`.
Changes reach public DNS within ~5 minutes.

⚠️ **After a write, an error never says "nothing changed" unless it is known.**
Three named outcomes, all `INTERNAL_ERROR` (not "invalid argument": re-running
the same call is exactly what must not happen blindly):

- `dns_outcome_unknown` — the DNS write itself got no answer (timeout, 5xx):
  re-read with `op="dns"` before anything else;
- `dns_not_kept` — Mailpool lost records on the write; the client restored
  the previous set and read it back, or the error says it could not;
- `partially_applied` — the DNS write landed, a later step did not; the error
  lists what was applied.

The DMARC policy and redirect-URL settings are not served: not verified live
yet (a later report-address change may republish the stored `p=`).

One client per tool call (`c = _client()`): the key is resolved once. Client
calls are written out (`c.get_domain_dns(…)`) so the version-skew probe
(`test_tools_client_methods_exist`) can check them.

        exact diff (`added`, `removed`) without writing anything. Re-call with
        `dry_run=False` to apply. Nothing is sent when there is no difference.

        Changes, combinable:
        - `spf_hard_fail=True` — end the apex SPF record in `-all` instead of
          `~all`. Only once every service sending as this domain is listed.
        - `dmarc_report_email` — where DMARC reports go. The record is also
          normalised: `fo`, `rf`, `ri` are dropped, policy and alignment kept.
          Mailpool always publishes the address as `rua` AND `ruf`. ⚠️ A domain
          without `_dmarc` gets one with p=quarantine; sp=quarantine; pct=100.
        - `tracking_host` + `tracking_target` — a custom tracking domain, e.g.
          `track` → `custom.lemlist.com` (the target comes from the sending tool).
          Replaces any CNAME already on that host.
        - `add_records` — NEW records next to the existing ones, e.g. a
          verification TXT a sending tool asks for. Never a second SPF: to
          change SPF, use `spf_hard_fail` or remove the old record and add the
          new one in the same call.
        - `remove_records` — records to delete, matched exactly.

        Safety: a change that would add an audit error (second SPF or `_dmarc`,
        MX, SPF or DKIM gone, CNAME next to other records) is refused, preview
        included. A DNS write replaces the WHOLE record set, so the full set is
        always sent, read back, and the previous set restored if a record went
        missing. Public DNS follows within ~5 minutes. After `dry_run=False`, an
        error whose reason is `dns_outcome_unknown`, `dns_not_kept` or
        `partially_applied` means records may have changed: re-read them with

            domain_id: Mailpool domain id.
