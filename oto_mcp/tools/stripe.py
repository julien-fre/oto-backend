"""Stripe — customers, subscriptions, invoices, payments, balance, catalog.

Wraps `oto.tools.stripe.client.StripeClient` (API v1, Bearer, form-encoded
bodies). THREE-field credential (`secret_kind="fields"`, resolved by
`access.resolve_credential_fields`): the key, plus two NON-secret satellites
that decide **what the key reads**.

- `api_version` — empty = the account's default version, the one the customer
  sees in their own dashboard. Pinning a version that diverges from the account
  silently changes response shapes.
- `stripe_account` — `acct_…` (Connect). This is not decoration: with
  Connect, THE SAME question returns the revenue of a DIFFERENT company
  depending on this header. Making it a credential field rather than a tool
  parameter is the strongest form of "never inferred per call": one
  credential = one set of books, set once, visible on the card, and
  impossible to switch mid-conversation.

**byo-only, never a platform key**: these are the customer's account books.
A Stripe key shared by several orgs makes no sense.

**Nothing moves money, and that is structural.** This module can NOT
refund, cancel, finalize, collect, send or delete: the corresponding methods
do not exist on `StripeClient` (a choice documented in its docstring). So this
is not a policy of this file, which a one-line PR would lift — it is a boundary
that takes an oto-core PR to move.

**Nine tools, one per business object** (ADR 0047), verb in `op=`. No parameter
is silently swallowed: an `op` that does not use a supplied argument REFUSES
(`_refuse_ignored` pattern, silae/granola).

**Live-tested on 2026-08-22** against a real Stripe account in test mode
(restricted key `rk_test_`): the 20 reads and the safe writes respond as coded.
Two behaviors the docs do not mention, both found by probing:

1. ⚠️ **`create_draft` does NOT pick up pending lines by default.** Creating
   a line (`op="add_item"`) then an invoice returned `total=0` and zero lines,
   the line staying `invoice=None`. An agent would have announced "invoice created"
   while producing an EMPTY invoice and leaving the amount dangling. Hence the
   default `pending_items="include"` here (measured: `total=4200`, 1 line).
2. ⚠️ **A payment link may require a `tax_code` on the product** when the
   account is eligible for managed payments: `create_link` returned
   `400 "the product tax code is missing"`. Setting `tax_code` on the product
   (e.g. `txcd_10000000`, generic services) unblocks it — the error message now
   says so explicitly.

        ⚠️ **A Stripe price is immutable on its amount.** "Change the price" means
        creating a NEW price and deactivating the old one — `update_price` only
        touches `active`, `metadata` and `nickname`. Say that rather than
        appearing to edit an amount.

        A **coupon** is the discount RULE (percent_off/amount_off, how long it
        applies); a **promotion code** is the TEXT a customer actually types at
        checkout, and always points at one coupon. Create the coupon first, then
        one or more promotion codes for it — several codes ("LAUNCH20",
        "PARTNER20") can share the same underlying coupon/discount.

        Deleting a product, price or coupon is not available here (and a Coupon
        has no `active` flag to toggle); revoke a promotion code instead
        (`update_promotion_code`, `active=false`) — the redemption rule stays on
        file but nothing more can be redeemed with it.

        ⚠️ Verified live 2026-08-23: a promotion code's `expires_at` cannot be
        LATER than its coupon's `redeem_by` — Stripe rejects it outright,
        naming both timestamps. And on a promotion code object, the coupon it
        applies is under `promotion.coupon` (with `promotion.type == "coupon"`),
        NOT a top-level `coupon` field — that flat shape was retired.
