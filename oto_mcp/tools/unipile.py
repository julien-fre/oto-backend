"""Unipile — hosted LinkedIn & WhatsApp (search / scrape / messaging).

⚠️ **One module, SEVEN connectors** since the 2026-08-28 split: `unipile` (the
account, which carries the key) and its six channels, of which `linkedin_unipile` is
served here. The other five have their own `tools/<channel>.py`, which calls the
shared messaging factory from here. See `docs/unipile.md` §The split.

The key is resolved per call **under the CHANNEL's connector**
(`unipile_client` → `access.resolve_credential(<channel>)`), not under `unipile`: this
is what makes the ACL and the activation OF THAT CHANNEL bite, since the gate reads the
name it is given. The key itself stays the account's — the delegation
(`Connector.credential_of`) normalizes within the cascade. The dsn (API v2: gateway
`api.unipile.com`) comes from the BYO credential's config; the platform key takes the
oto-core client default (api.unipile.com), which reads no env.

Why alongside the `linkedin` browser connector: the session lives at Unipile
(real Chrome + residential proxy), which sidesteps the TLS fingerprint and the
local browser's session isolation (issue #5) — at the price of a paid SaaS.

    """"Is my {provider} account connected, and is its session alive?"

    Born from signal **#452** (org 2, 14/08/2026). The NAME `linkedin_unipile_account`
    promises the account's state; the tool only served the premium slate (Recruiter /
    Sales Navigator contracts). An agent that came to check "is my LinkedIn
    connected?" invented `op='status'`, got an `invalid_arguments` (call
    248959, args `{op:'status'}`) and concluded "not connected" — while the channel
    was, and a user reported "it doesn't work".

    Two constraints, both drawn from this failure mode:

    - **It ANSWERS, it does not raise.** With no linked account, `unipile_client()` raises
      an McpError: building the status on it would have replaced a false negative with an
      error, i.e. changed nothing. Here, "not connected" is an ANSWER.
    - **It resolves like a real call.** `resolve_operated_account_id` is
      exactly what `unipile_client()` goes through (pin `_account=`, granted account #55,
      the org's own account) — so "status says connected" implies
      "a call will find an account". Any other reading would recreate the card that
      reassures while the calls fail.

    `connected` ≠ `alive`: an account stays LINKED in the database while its session is
    dead (checkpoint, rotated cookie — #236), and that is precisely the state where a green
    card misleads the most. `alive=None` = probe unavailable, not "dead".

    **It LINKS, like `GET /api/me/unipile`.** There is no webhook any more (#581): a
    freshly connected account is only attached by `reconcile_pending`, under the
    sub that requested the link. The REST side does it on every status read; the
    agent side did it NOWHERE — an onboarding started by
    `unipile_connect_start` could therefore only succeed if the person reopened their
    card in a dashboard within the hour (experienced: org 270, 2026-09-03/14). No-op
    without a pending (no network call), never fatal. When nothing was linked, the
    established reason surfaces in `binding` — `no_candidate` used to be silent everywhere.

    `account_id_hint` = the `account_id` that the flow's return page carries in
    its address, relayed by the agent: it is the PROOF that the agent side lacks
    (oto#247). Without it, the reconciliation refuses to choose between several accounts
    connected in the same window on the shared key (`ambiguous_candidates`).

    The secret of a published endpoint authenticates the PROJECT, not a person: the
    per-member resolution (`resolve_operated_account_id`) has nothing to hook onto and
    raised "Unauthenticated". As a result, a project shared with a third party lost
    LinkedIn — half the contacts of an enrichment mission — and the only
    alternative was to hand over a NOMINAL `oto_` token, which carries the entire
    organization (356 tools, `email_send`, `data_delete_datastore`): indefensible before the
    compliance of a client under a processing contract.

    The missing information already existed: the project DECLARES its connector identities
    (`project_links.identity_ref`). We use it — that is what makes the project secret a
    truly restricted token: a project's perimeter, under the identities it declares.

    Two guards, both necessary:
    - **membership** — the identity must be a LIVE account of the org that owns the
      project. The shared Unipile key addresses the platform's whole subscription: without this
      cross-check, a project link naming any `acc_…` would make a public endpoint
      act under another tenant's LinkedIn.
    - **channel** — the `provider` filter replaces here the rule "several bindings ⇒
      ambiguous, we give up": a project that declares LinkedIn AND WhatsApp under the same
      `unipile` connector says nothing ambiguous, it declares two channels.

    Never a fallback: neither on another account of the org, nor on the first of the subscription.

        page of THEIR product. ⚠️ There is NO webhook (#581): the account is

        reopens their connections page. This is THE messaging onboarding entry point

        ⚠️ **Recruiter / Sales Navigator faceted search** (skills,
        industry, location, employer): first read the guide
        `oto_guide(op=read, slug="linkedin-search")`. Four traps that SKEW results
        silently: (1) a facet requires a **resolved ID** — pass the term through
        `linkedin_unipile_facets` and give the chosen `id`; a raw term does NOT filter;
        (2) the `url=` mode is **capped at 25 without pagination** — prefer the structured one
        to control the filters, not for volume: it is the PRODUCT (`api=`) that
        decides on pagination (`classic` does not paginate, whatever the mode);
        (3) a facet may be **NOT applied** by the chosen product, without an error
        (measured: same employer → 0 in `sales_navigator`, 10 in `classic`) — a **0 on a
        faceted search does not prove an empty pool**, cross-check;
        (4) pagination is **CURSOR-ONLY**: the filters passed alongside the `cursor`
        are not re-applied, and page 2 **sometimes loses the employer filter** —
        check the employer of the items of a paginated page.

        **The return**: always `items` + `cursor`. `total_count` **only when
        upstream announces one** — the ordinary tier (`api="classic"`) carries
        none: no population count by this route. When it is there,
        `returned` + `truncated: true` say that the page returns less; `truncated`
        **without** `cursor` = the rest is UNREACHABLE (product cap, e.g. 25 out of 86).
        Without a total, neither `returned` nor `truncated`: the absence of `cursor` then does
        NOT prove a complete sweep, and a `warnings` says so. Read `warnings` before
        reporting "empty pool" or "population swept".

        ⚠️ **Cadence**: LinkedIn rate-limits per account. Chaining dozens
        of calls in a burst triggers a `429`, then DEGRADES and ends up DISCONNECTING
        the account. The requested backoff FOLLOWS your recent cadence: a few seconds
        after a light burst, up to ~1h after a sustained chain — read
        the returned delay, do not assume it is short. Space out your calls; on a
        `429`, respect THAT delay and SLOW DOWN — do not insist.
        For volume, delegate the pagination to a sub-agent (guide `bulk-load`).

        `company`/`location`/`industry` accept NAMES (automatically resolved
        into LinkedIn facets) or numeric facet ids. ⚠️ The LinkedIn company
        page is NOT a valid employer facet id for people search —
        pass the name and let the client resolve.

        ⚠️ **COMPANY fields missing from the result** (size, description, industry):
        enrich them per DISTINCT company, never per profile. Deduplicate the
        employers of your results (far fewer than the people), then
        `linkedin_unipile_profile(op="company", identifier=<name or slug>)` for each —
        the profile is CACHED 6h, a re-looked-up company does not consume quota again. For
        French companies, `fr_search` gives the headcount (= the size) FOR FREE,
        with no LinkedIn quota. Do NOT query each person one by one for these company
        fields (that is the "844 calls" trap: counting per profile what is
        done per employer).

        Args:
            keywords: Keywords (name, job title…).
            category: "people" or "companies".
            company: Employer(s) — names or facet ids.
            location: Location(s) — names or facet ids.
            industry: industry filter — dict `{include?: [...], exclude?: [...]}` (names or ids).
                ⚠️ `exclude` is NOT supported by `api="classic"` (raises an error):
                LinkedIn classic only accepts a list of industries to INCLUDE. To
                exclude an industry, use `api="sales_navigator"` or `"recruiter"`.
            network_distance: degree of connection — `[1]`=1st degree (your 1st-degree connections),
                `[2]`=2nd, `[3]`=3rd+. Combinable (`[1, 2]`) → targets "my 1st-degree in [city]".

        `identifier` = **public slug** (`marie-dupont`) or **URN** (`ACoAA…`). NOT the
        numeric `member_id` from `linkedin_unipile_search`: the v2 API rejects it
        (`400 Invalid User ID`) — go through the slug, which these ops resolve for you.

        `op`:
        - **"person"** (default): full profile (dated career, schools, network).
          ⚠️ LinkedIn may throttle a section (often `experience`): the response
          then carries `throttled_sections=[…]` with the section empty despite a
          `*_total_count` > 0. This is an UPSTREAM rate-limit, not an absence of data:
          retry later (minutes), reduce concurrency (≤8 in parallel), and
          in a batch handle these targets in a deferred catch-up pass.
          Also CHECK that the returned `public_identifier`/id == the requested one before
          writing (reject + retry otherwise).
        - **"company"**: company profile. Cached 6h per account (~static
          profiles) — the same company looked up again does not consume the upstream quota
          (~100 profiles/12h per account).
        - **"me"**: profile of the connected account itself (the "me" under which the
          other ops act). No `identifier`.
        - **"posts"** / **"comments"**: what a member publishes / comments — to
          spot a post to comment on/like, or what a prospect engages with.
          Each item's text is served as an EXCERPT (600 characters, cut marked
          `text_truncated: true`): the raw is 55-75 KB for 10 posts, and triage is done on
          the header. `text_max_chars=None` returns the full text, `op="get"` of
          `linkedin_unipile_post` a specific post. To slim further, `fields`
          (e.g. `["text","posted_at","social_id"]`) keeps only those fields — `id`/
          `social_id` are always kept so you can chain.
        - **"reactions"**: posts a member has liked.
        - **"followers"** / **"following"**: followers of the connected account, or of a
          member via `identifier`. Paginated.
        - **"endorse"**: endorses a skill (`skill_endorsement_id` =
          `endorsement_id` of a skill returned by op="person").
        - **"action"**: premium action on a member (Sales Navigator lead save
          / Recruiter pipeline). Requires `api` + `action`.

        Args:
            op: person (default) | company | me | posts | comments | reactions |

          Each 1-to-1 thread is enriched with `attendee_name`/`attendee_headline`/
          `attendee_profile_url` (resolved in batch — the raw `name` of 1-to-1 threads
          is null and `attendee_provider_id` is opaque). `with_names=False` turns off
          this enrichment (raw payload, one API call fewer).
          ⚠️ **The enrichment may not happen, and the response SAYS so**: an

          Sponsored/promo inserts are excluded. The choice of posts follows your
          LinkedIn home setting. Next page: pass the returned `cursor` again
          (`None` = end of the stream). Returns `{items, cursor, count}`.
          **Served as a TRIAGE VIEW**: each post returns enough to rank it (author +
          headline, date, traction, link, `urn`) and its text cut at 600 characters
          (`text_truncated: true` marks the cut) — a page of 40 raw posts exceeds
          the size of a tool result, and sorting a feed is done on the header.

          `{items, count, truncated, next_offset, stopped}` — `truncated: true` says that

          429 is the `unipile_rate_limited` refusal (delay in
          `retry_after_seconds`); after a first page, it returns the partial result.

        `op`:
        - **"relations"** (default): your 1st-degree connections — to target/export your
          direct network. Paginated (`cursor`). Returns `{items, cursor, …}` — a single
          list. `fields` = PROJECTION: keeps only those fields on each item
          (e.g. `["name","headline","public_identifier","created_at"]`), plus
          `member_id` always kept — reduces an export's payload. A key
          that no connection on the page carries is REFUSED, with the keys
          present.
          ⚠️ Pagination is NOT reliable for an EXHAUSTIVE export: the `cursor` encodes a
          volatile offset (duplicates in the offset space, overestimated total) and a
          `limit=100` page returns 90-100 items, not 100. To load a whole network:
          deduplicate by `member_id` (NEVER the offset), keep ≤6 pages in parallel,
          ~20 s between two salvos (measured: 8 in parallel → `429 "We only allow
          10 requests"` on 3 of them; beyond that, cascading 502s), prove
          exhaustion with 2 staggered passes.
          ⚠️ These six precautions are ALL there is to know: they live here,
          there is no page to go read. The `bulk-load` guide deals with something else
          — delegating a big load to a sub-agent — and says nothing about the
          pagination traps above. ⚠️ An incomplete load does NOT RAISE,
          it returns fewer people: a process that reads the absence as "not a
          connection" will then act on a wrong answer.
        - **"invitations"**: the connection invitations. `direction`='received'
          (received, to accept) or 'sent' (sent, pending). Paginated — `limit`
          (default 50, MAX 100: beyond that upstream returns "Invalid querystring";
          and with no limit the whole backlog exceeds the token limit).
          For the next page, pass the `cursor` RETURNED by the previous call
          — and only that: a hand-made cursor is refused. No more returned `cursor`
          = end of the backlog (a SHORT page is not the end), unless
          `pagination_note` is present: it then says why pagination
          stopped there, and there is nothing more to ask for. `direction` is
          repeated on each page, it cannot be deduced from the cursor.
        - **"invite"**: sends a connection request (2nd/3rd-degree outreach).
          `provider_id` = the `provider_id` field of a `linkedin_unipile_search`
          / `linkedin_unipile_profile` result; `message` = note ≤300 characters.
        - **"handle"**: accepts or declines a RECEIVED invitation. `invitation_id` AND
          `shared_secret` come from the SAME item of op="invitations"
          (direction='received'); `action` = 'accept' or 'decline'.
