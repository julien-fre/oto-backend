        directors, finances, matched establishments. At least one filter required.

        ⚠️ **Enumeration capped at ~10,000** (`page × per_page`, per_page ≤ 25):
        the API truncates **without error** beyond that. To enumerate a large
        set exhaustively ("all companies in sector X in region Y" when there are
        tens of thousands), switch to **`fr_stock_search`** (SIRENE parquet,
        no cap). This tool remains the right choice for searching/qualifying (indexed,
        fast, rich filters) as long as the result stays under ~10k.

        ⚠️ Geographic filters (departement, code_postal, commune) match ANY
        establishment, NOT only the head office (siège). To target companies whose
        SIÈGE is in a département, use `fr_stock_search(departement=…,
        sieges_only=True)`.

        ⚠️ **`ca_min`/`ca_max` do NOT qualify a company's size.** The
        filter applies to an amount whose unit varies by filing (euros or
        thousands, sometimes from one year to the next for the same company) and whose
        0 means "not declared" — so any upper bound brings back en masse
        companies whose revenue is unknown, which biases toward the LARGEST.
        Measured: `tranche_effectif_salarie=51,52,53 & ca_max=400000` returns 12
        results, all large companies, no true positive. To target by
        size, use `tranche_effectif_salarie` or `categorie_entreprise`.
        The `finances` block of the results carries the same caveats, flagged
        line by line (`alerte`) — see `finances_avertissement`.

        Spoken legal forms: people say "the SCI Untel", but the register rarely writes
        the form into the name — so a query like "SCI ASC" only matches companies
        literally NAMED that. On page 1, this tool detects such a prefix and ALSO runs
        the name alone filtered on that form, appending the extra hits (flagged
        `matched_by="legal_form"`) and reporting what it did under `legal_form_retry`.

        Args:
            query: Full-text search (company name, SIREN, brand…).
            naf: NAF activity codes, comma-separated (e.g. "62.01Z,62.02A").
            departement: Department code (e.g. "75").
            code_postal: Postal code (e.g. "75001").
            commune: INSEE commune code (COG, 5 digits — e.g. "67482" for
                Strasbourg). NOT a city name (a name raises "valeur non valide" — the API's French error message).
                For a place, pass `code_postal`, or use `fr_stock_search` (which
                resolves enseigne/commune by code too).
            employees: Employee-range codes (INSEE TEFEN) of the unité légale, comma-separated.
            categorie_entreprise: INSEE size category — "PME", "ETI" or "GE".
            ca_min: Minimum turnover — ⚠️ NOT reliably in euros, see below.
            ca_max: Maximum turnover — ⚠️ NOT reliably in euros, see below.
            idcc: IDCC codes (conventions collectives), comma-separated.
            nature_juridique: INSEE legal-form codes, comma-separated (e.g. "6540" for
                SCI, "5710" for SAS). Exact 4-digit codes only — an invalid value makes
                the API answer with the full list of valid ones.
            page: 1-based page number.

        necessarily carry revenue** — a simplified balance sheet has no
        "total revenue" box. For revenue, go back through the years: `fr_bilans(siren)`
        returns them from most recent to oldest with their `chiffre_d_affaires`, and you
        must take the first one that carries one. Do not conclude "no revenue"
        from `latest_bilan` alone. Seen on Norauto: last year
        (simplified) silent, €974,718,176 the year before.

        BATCH: pass `sirens=[…]` (max 20 per call, chunk beyond) to qualify a
        LIST in one call — returns `{profiles: […], count}`, one profile per
        SIREN in input order; per-SIREN failures degrade to `{error, siren}`
        without failing the batch. For bulk HQ addresses only (no financials),
        `fr_stock_enrich` is cheaper.

        `latest_bilan` is trimmed to 7 B2B-relevant ratios (CA, résultat net,
        EBE, marge EBE, autonomie financière, taux d'endettement, liquidité).
        For the full ratio set, call `fr_bilan(siren, date_cloture)`.

        Resilient to per-source failures: a timeout or error on INPI (bilan) or
        BODACC (events) degrades gracefully — the available blocks are returned
        and the failing sources are listed under `partial_errors`. Only an
        identity failure (the keystone source) fails the whole call.

            siren: SIREN number (9 digits) — single-company mode.
            sirens: list of SIREN numbers (max 20) — batch mode. Give one OR

        order.

        ⚠️ An empty `dirigeants` has THREE meanings, told apart by `registre`:
        the SIREN is unknown (`error: "not_found"`), the legal form is not
        registered so it declares nobody (`hors_registre` — association,
        commune: the emptiness says nothing about the company), or the company
        is registered with nobody on file (`attendu`). Never read an empty list
        as "no director" without reading `registre`. `personnes_physiques`
        counts the NAMED natural persons — a company whose only director is
        another company scores 0.

        ⚠️ **`count` counts the records OBTAINED, not the lines returned** —
        `en_echec` and `erreurs` name what is missing, at the top level.
        ⚠️ **An `error` other than `not_found` is an upstream failure, not a fact
        about the company** — and it is RETRYABLE.

        A batch of 50 where 21 calls failed returns `count: 29`, `en_echec: 21`
        and names those 21 SIRENs in `erreurs` — at the top level, like
        `not_found`, because a hundred-line list is not re-read to find them.
        Reading `count` and `not_found` alone used to say "50 records, none
        missing" while 21 companies silently dropped out of the deliverable.
        The batch paces itself and retries the upstream quota (429, honouring
        `Retry-After`), so what reaches you has already been given a second
        chance; a SIREN still in `erreurs` says the upstream is busy, never that

        Neutral primitive returning raw rows — compose your own need via filters,
        sort and per-company reduction.

        ⚠️ `themes` PROVES PRESENCE, NEVER ABSENCE. Theme codes come from DILA's
        own indexing of the filing: declarative, uneven, and demonstrably
        incomplete. Measured case — CAFES BIBAL VENDING (SIREN 345255087) filed
        the SAME kind of agreement twice: the 2019 one is coded 111/112, the
        2025 one is coded 081-084 only, yet its article 5 ("Régime de
        remboursement complémentaire de frais de santé et de prévoyance")
        re-institutes health AND pension for 4 years. Filtering on 111/112 there
        returns the 2019 act alone — reading "no recent act" off that is a FALSE
        NEGATIVE produced by the source, not by this tool. Health clauses
        routinely travel inside an agreement titled "égalité professionnelle" or
        "NAO", and get coded accordingly.

        Consequence for prospecting: to assert a company's scheme is DORMANT,
        theme codes are not enough — search by `siren` WITHOUT `themes`, then
        read the recent acts with `fr_accords_text` (health sections carry very
        stable headings: "frais de santé", "régime de prévoyance",
        "complémentaire santé"). Use `themes` to FIND candidates cheaply, the
        text to CONFIRM the ones you are about to act on.

        Common recipes:
        - Who just renegotiated their health/pension scheme (candidates, not an
          exhaustive set): themes=["111","112"], nature="AVENANT", sort_dir="desc".
        - Does THIS company have a health/pension agreement, and when: search by
          siren WITHOUT themes, sort_dir="desc", then read the recent acts.
        - PROSPECTING AUTONOMOUS SMEs (skip group subsidiaries, whose insurance is
          decided at HQ): exclude_categories=["GE"]. 26% of the companies filing a
          health/pension agreement are GE — filtering here is one query instead of
          a per-company qualification pass.

        Args:
            query: Substring in the agreement TITLE (ILIKE) — not in its text. The
                local index holds metadata only; body text is fetched per act by
                fr_accords_text, so a clause cannot be searched across the corpus.
            themes: Theme codes (OR). Health/pension: "111" (complémentaire santé),
                "112" (prévoyance), "113" (retraite supplémentaire). Use
                fr_accords_themes to discover codes. Presence-only — see the
                warning above before concluding anything from their ABSENCE.
            nature: ACCORD (initial) | AVENANT (amendment = renegotiation) | …
            siren: Company SIREN (9 digits) — matches ALL its establishments.
                PREFER this over siret to check a company: ACCO files an agreement
                under the DEPOSITING establishment's SIRET, often not the siège, so a
                siège-SIRET lookup misses agreements.
            siret: Exact establishment SIRET (14 digits).
            idcc: Exact branch code (convention collective).
            departement: Postal code prefix (2 digits).
            date_from / date_to: Bounds on the signature date (YYYY-MM-DD).
            latest_per_siret: Keep only one row per company — its most recent act —
                BEFORE applying date_from/date_to (so date bounds then filter the
                company's LAST act → dormant-contract detection).
            sort_by: date | date_depot | date_diffusion | date_maj (default date).
            sort_dir: asc (oldest first) | desc (newest first).
            limit: Max results (default 20, max 100).
            offset: Skip that many rows — page N = offset=(N-1)*limit. THE way to
                exhaust a result set bigger than `limit`: `total_count` tells you
                the volume, walk it with offset (do NOT slide `date_from`, which
                loses rows silently when more than `limit` share the same date).
            tranche_effectifs: INSEE employee-range codes (TEFEN) of the filing
                establishment, e.g. ["11","12","21"] — ACCO carries no company
                size, so this is resolved against the local SIRENE stock. Use it to
                keep SMEs only instead of post-filtering by hand.
            exclude_categories: drop these INSEE size categories ("PME"|"ETI"|"GE").
                THE way to skip group subsidiaries: the category is computed by
                INSEE over the GROUP perimeter, so a subsidiary that is small by
                its own headcount still reads "GE" (GTIE Rennes, €8M and a 20-49
                band, is a GE because it belongs to VINCI). No other field carries
                that. Resolved against the SIRENE legal-unit stock.
            categories_entreprise: keep ONLY these categories. ⚠️ NOT the mirror of
                exclude_categories: 4% of the companies filing an agreement have no
                category on record — an inclusion drops them (you cannot assert a
                company is an SME without knowing), an exclusion keeps them. To
                target autonomous SMEs, prefer exclude_categories=["GE"].
            scan_cap: how many agreements the SIRENE cross-check examines before
                paginating (default 5000, max 25000). `effectifs_filter.truncated`
                =true in the response means the pool is LARGER than this cap — the
                answer is then NOT exhaustive. Raise it to cover a whole pool
                (health/pension nationally is ~9700 agreements).
