"""Datastore — lightweight structured data storage per user (native PG, ADR 0016).

Each user has their own set of "datastores". Free schema: each row = a JSON
dict (stored as JSONB, types preserved), fields appear as they go. Three
auto-managed fields exposed flat: `_id`, `_created_at`,
`_updated_at`. No external dependency — self-contained platform surface.

Surface ("fewer tools, more args"): `data_write`/`data_rows`/`data_share`
merge append↔update / get↔list / share↔unshare via a mode arg. The
destructive ones (delete_datastore, delete_row) and creation stay separate.

        ⚠️ **The vocabulary is CLOSED: a key its level does not admit is REFUSED** —
        at the head, on a field, on a sub-field, in `of`, in `lifecycle`. The refusal
        names the path, the key and the closest known one (`read_only` → `readonly`),
        or where it belongs (`states` → `lifecycle.states`, `semantic_search` → a
        parameter of this call). An unknown key ALREADY stored and left unchanged is
        tolerated (named in `warning`), never one you add or change. Your own
        annotations go in `meta` — an object, allowed at every level, carried as is,
        never read, bounded in size. Help text goes in `description` (`note`,
        `help`, `hint`, `placeholder` are refused). Each level's keys, who reads
        each one and the `meta` bound (`meta_max_bytes`) are served at
        `GET /api/datastore/schema/keys`.
        ⚠️ This REPLACES the schema — it does not merge. Any setting absent from the
        body you send DISAPPEARS (a field note, a bound, options, the business key and
        its UNIQUE index). The response now names what it just removed
        (`declarations_effacees`, with the lost VALUES — it is the only copy left) and
        `enforced` (the validation keys THIS version applies). To EDIT a schema without
        risking part of it, use `data_patch_schema`: it merges by key and cannot
        destroy what it does not name.
        The response also carries `existing_violations`: per path (`contacts[].email`),
        the rows ALREADY IN PLACE that the posed schema condemns — `rows`,
        `blocking_rows` (rows that accept no write at all until fixed), `sample_ids`
        and `consequence`. Clean them before arming the guard;
        `existing_violations_scope.complete: false` means the row cap was hit and the
        counts are floors.

        The optional top-level `"key"` names the field that is the row's BUSINESS KEY
        (e.g. "email", "siren"). <<cle_metier>>
        <<colonnes_non_declarees>>
        ONE head setting is left (`strict`, `unknown_fields` and `key_required` were
        replaced on 2026-10-02; `unknown_columns` was REMOVED on 2026-10-05 — no
        setting decides what is checked, all are refused):
        - `"new_rows"` — whether a NEW row may be born: `"create"` (default) or
          `"reject"`, which CLOSES the table: a write that designates NO existing
          row (no `id`, and no key value the table already carries) is REFUSED
          instead of creating one. Needs `key`. A table often fills up before it
          has its key, hence the default.
        `data_get_schema` serves it AS APPLIED (`reglages`). Pass schema=null to
        switch back to free-table mode.

        PRESENTATION — the schema also DRIVES THE UI (there is no visual editor:
        this tool IS the way to configure how a table looks):
        - field ORDER in the record view = the order of `fields` here. Reorder the
          list to reorder the form.
        - `type` picks the WIDGET: `date`/`datetime` → date picker (readable, not a
          raw ISO string), `url` → compact field + open link (never a giant text
          box), `email` → mail field, `enum` (+ `options: [...]`) → dropdown,
          `bool` → true/false, `number` → numeric. Untyped fields fall back to a
          plain text box, so DECLARE the type when the rendering matters.
        - `width: "half"|"full"` = the field's width in the record form. Without it
          the width is derived from the widget — declare it to keep a stable layout.
        - `hidden: true` = keep the field OUT of the table columns by default (still
          editable in the record). Use it for opaque ids and technical fields.
        - `display: "title"` NAMES the row: that field titles the record everywhere
          the server names a line (work queue, undo, cards) instead of a raw `_id`.
          One per table.
        - `role` only steers the dashboard's rendering (`metric` tiles, `note`
          placed last, `status` badges) — oto does not read it: a `lifecycle` block
          designates its own column, no role needed.
          ⚠️ The dashboard still titles rows from `role: "title"`, which the server
          no longer reads. On a table meant to look right in BOTH, declare both until
          they converge.

        STRUCTURED RECORDS (ADR 0046 — every layer opt-in):
        - nested types: `type:"object"` + `fields:[…]` (sub-record, e.g. occupant);
          `type:"list"` + `of:<field-def>` (list of scalars or sub-records, e.g.
          contacts = list of {nom, titre, email}).
        - write validation: `field.required: true`, type conformity,
          `field.required_when: {"<field>": "<value>"}` (e.g. deliverables required
          when status="qualified" — ⚠️ to UNDO, clear the gated field AND leave the
          triggering state in the SAME `data_write` call: the gate is judged on the
          MERGED row, so a call that only clears the field while the state still
          matches is refused), `field.max_length: <int>` on a SCALAR field, and
          `field.pattern: "<regex>"` for its SHAPE when the size does not separate
          anything (a code, a snake_case identifier) — `re.search`, so anchor it
          yourself (`^…$`). A `pattern` applies on its own: the value it reads is
          bounded by `max_length` when declared (≤1000), else by 1000 characters —
          a longer value is refused. The cost of a regex is bounded against that
          length, and oto refuses what it cannot price — an ambiguous repeated
          group, a backreference, a lookaround are rejected AT DECLARATION TIME,
          each naming why. `type: "phone"` holds a phone number: international
          (`+`, country code — E.164) preferred, national digits accepted, spaces,
          dots and dashes allowed; a sentence or an identifier is refused.
          `field.required_layers: ["comment"]` refuses a write that leaves a
          NON-EMPTY value in that column without posting the layer — the value must
          arrive WITH its provenance, in the SAME call
          (`"col": {"valeur": …, "comment": "where it comes from"}`). A null or
          empty value, and a layer posted alone without a value (a note beside the
          value, not an assumed empty — that is `@empty`), trigger nothing — even
          when the value already in place lacks the layer: that is how you add it
          (`"col": {"comment": …}`), without re-sending the value.
          Applies to sub-fields of objects and of list items too; never to
          `readonly` nor the lifecycle column; never to a column this
          write does not name. It arms ITSELF — no head setting needed. ⚠️ It does NOT
          make a comment TRUE: it forces you to NAME a source, which makes a lie
          checkable — the truth is still established on the documents.
          Every declared constraint applies (the format as a whole from the date
          above). A non-conforming write FAILS naming the culprit
          (max_length reports the actual length AND the bound; pattern reports the
          value it saw AND the motif).
          Only what a write SETS is judged: a row whose stored value is already
          off-format still accepts a write to its OTHER columns — the stale value
          is named back in `hors_type`, never a reason to refuse.
          Fields the caller does NOT write — one question ("whose column is this?"),
          and each refusal names the field, the reason and where the thing goes:
          `field.readonly: true` refuses a write that CHANGES a value already SET
          (layers stay open — what another source says goes in `<field>.comment`);
          a cell with NO value (key absent, `null` or `""`) can still be filled once,
          `@empty` counts as set, and clearing a set value (`null`) is a change;
          ⚠️ `field.origine: "system"` was REMOVED on 2026-09-08 and is now
          REFUSED like any unknown key. Nothing captures a previous value
          automatically any more: the origin is set by the call that BRINGS the
          data, with `donnees_d_origine=true` (`data_write` says how). Re-sending
          the SAME value is never a write, so re-emitting a record you just read
          always passes.
          Bound the fields meant to hold ONE short value (a job title, a city): a
          column that collects reasoning stops being groupable/filterable. The
          bound applies to the keys a write actually SETS, so rows already over it
          keep working until that field is rewritten — and setting a bound on a
          table that already overflows answers with a `warning` saying how many.
        - lifecycle: the column that carries the block IS the status column (no
          `role` tag needed), `lifecycle: {states:[…],
          transitions:{from:[to…]}, terminal?:[…]}` — unknown state or undeclared
          transition is refused. Each `transitions` value is a LIST, even for one
          destination: `{"a": ["b"]}`; `{"a": "b"}` is refused at declaration; `terminal` is a LIST too. ⚠️ It no longer releases the work-queue claim:
          writing a "final" state does NOT free the row (#317). Release is a gesture
          of the LOCK — data_release, or closing your run — never an inference from
          a business value.
        - step labels: `lifecycle.labels: {"a_qualifier": "To qualify", …}` — the
          name a screen shows for each state instead of its code. Presentation
          only: no write reads it, a row still carries the code. Each key must be a
          state of `states` (an unknown one is REFUSED and named), each value a
          non-empty string of at most 60 characters; a state without a label is
          fine (the screen derives one from the code).
        - work-queue ceiling: `lifecycle.max_claims: <int >= 1>` +
          `lifecycle.abandon_state: "<terminal state>"` — a row claimed that many
          times WITHOUT a successful write leaves the queue in that state, with a
          platform reason in `_abandon` (ending with what the last attempt hit; its
          run in `_abandon_run`). Both go together: a ceiling without an
          abandon state, or an abandon state that is not terminal, is REFUSED here.
          Counter (`_claims`) resets on the first successful write to the row.
          Undeclared, a platform default ceiling (3) still applies: the row is set
          aside with its reason in `_abandon`, its status left untouched.
          `lifecycle.claimable: {col: val | {op: val}}` (`filter` grammar) = the
          rows the queue SERVES: no claim hands out a row outside it, whatever
          `filter` says.
        - passes: `lifecycle.advance: {"societe": "dirigeant", "dirigeant": "email"}`
          — the counterpart of `abandon_state`. A claimed row RELEASED (data_release,
          run_finish) after at least one successful write since its claim moves to
          the next state, as a platform revision of that run. Agents claim by state
          and never write it; if a pass writes the state itself, its write wins. No
          write, no move (the ceiling applies). Each step must be a declared
          transition, never from a terminal state — refused here otherwise.

        SEMANTIC SEARCH (#67 V2.2 — opt-in per datastore): pass `semantic_search=true`
        to make this datastore's ROWS findable by MEANING via oto_search (not just exact
        words), embedding each row (has a per-row cost → off by default; enable it on the
        tables you actually search by concept). `false` turns it off and purges the
        embeddings. Passing ONLY `semantic_search` leaves the schema untouched.

        Args:
            datastore: target datastore (must exist; you must have write access).
            schema: the schema object, or null to clear it. Head key

                setting any more); a field may carry `readonly: true` (a value once set is
                locked, an empty cell fills; layers open). ⚠️ `origine` was REMOVED on 2026-09-08 and is refused — the

                (`donnees_d_origine=true`), not by a schema format.

        ⚠️ **Provenance goes in `comment`, never in `origine`.** Put WHAT you
        established and WHERE it came from in `<field>.comment`, and the page in
        `<field>.link`. `origine` is the platform's layer — an agent never writes
        it. Writing `<field>.origine` is REFUSED unless the call declares
        `origine_override=true` — which belongs to an import, not to a write of
        your own.

        <<couches>>
        What a write destroys, what `readonly` and the business key protect,
        and where the REST face differs: guide `datastore-semantics`
        (`oto_guide op=read slug=datastore-semantics`).

        ⚠️ **Writing a value DROPS the `comment` and `link` that came with it** —
        they described the OLD value. To keep one while the value changes, send it
        back as it is.

        Two gestures on a cell, and only two:
        `null` = ERASE the cell: `{"field": null}`. The erased value is kept
        nowhere: the response hands it back once, in `valeurs_effacees`.
        `"@empty"` = "searched, nothing found", its reason in `comment`:
        `{"valeur": "@empty", "comment": "registry and imprint: none"}`. It
        satisfies `required` (a plain `""` does not) and reads back `""` — or
        `"@empty"` with `empties="sentinel"`. On a layer (`comment`, `link`), it
        only empties that layer.

        ⚠️ **On a cell that holds a value: keep it and write the layers alone
        (`{"field": {"comment": "…"}}`), erase it with `null`, or discard it with
        `@empty` and the reason in `comment`.** A field you leave out is "not mine" —
        its value stays. A `comment` alone is a note beside the value, never
        "searched, nothing found".

        <<mots_deprecies>>

        `""` and `[]` are values: they REPLACE the value in place, like any other
        value, and the replaced value comes back in `valeurs_effacees`. To keep a
        value, leave the field out; to erase it, write `null`.

        <<upsert_implicite>>

        <<colonnes_non_declarees>>

        ⚠️ **`@empty` must be the ENTIRE sub-field, alone.** Mixed into a sentence it
        is just text and gets stored as such — `"@empty ; nothing on the imprint"`
        lands in the cell verbatim, and a client reads it in their deliverable. The
        reason goes in `comment`.

        In a list, the word goes on the element's field:
        `{"contacts": [{"nom": "Alice", "fonction": "@empty"}]}`. A list whose schema
        declares no `of.key` is REPLACED by what you send: read the row with
        `empties="sentinel"` and send each element back as it came, so an assumed
        empty stays `"@empty"`. Refused on an element's identity (`of.key`), in a list
        of plain values, and inside an object or a `json` column.

        ONE element of a list is written at its RANK — the address you read and
        filter by: `{"contacts[1].email": "d@x.fr"}` (or `{"valeur": …, "comment":
        …}`; `contacts[1].email.comment` alone annotates it, `null` erases it).
        `{"contacts[+]": {…a whole record…}}` appends, `{"contacts[0]": null}` removes.
        Ranks start at 0 and point at the list AS YOU READ IT; the append comes last.
        To add or remove WITHOUT reading the row first: `{"tags[+]": ["x", "y"]}`
        appends one element or a list of them, in order, duplicates kept;
        `{"tags[-]": ["x"]}` removes every occurrence of each value (plain values
        only — a record is removed at its rank; an absent value is refused). Both are
        applied under the row lock: two concurrent appends both land. On a `text`
        column, `{"journal[+]": "…"}` appends a line to the cell (a list = several
        lines) without resending it; a log kept by many is better as a table.
        Refused, with the form that works: a rank that does not exist (append with
        `contacts[+]`), `contacts[0]: {…}` (write its fields), `contacts[].x`, and the
        whole column together with one of its ranks.

        A requirement declared on a sub-field (`required`, `options`, `max_length`…
        on an element's `nom`) is enforced like one on a column. In a list with
        `of.key`, only the elements your write CHANGES are judged: an element sent
        back unchanged never blocks yours — its defect comes back in `hors_type`.
        Written at its rank, only that element is judged, with or without `of.key`.

        Dates: a `date`/`datetime` column reads ISO in any variant, `04/09/2026`
        (day first) and Unix timestamps, and STORES one form — `2026-09-04T10:00:00Z`
        (UTC) for an instant, `2026-09-04` for a day; known only to the month or the
        year, it stays `2026-09` / `2026`. An instant without a time zone is taken as
        UTC, and `notices` says so: write its offset (`+02:00`) if it is local time.

        A schema refusal ends with the payload to send back: only the fields to fix,
        a `<…>` template in place of each value, `| @empty` where that is allowed —
        `{"contacts": [{"role": "RH", "nom": "<texte> | @empty"}]}`. Fill the
        templates and write again; a list goes back WHOLE, that element fixed in
        its place (by its `of.key`, else its rank), the others as they were — or
        write only that element's fields at its rank (`contacts[1].nom`).

        ⚠️ **A write DESTROYS what is in the column.** On an open column there is no
        undo: the previous value leaves the row the moment yours lands. It survives
        only in the row's revision journal — `data_row_history` serves each write's
        before and after, kept 90 days by default — and nothing puts it back for you.
        If the value was supplied by the table's owner, announce what you are about to
        change on a column you did not fill yourself.

        ⚠️ **There is NO automatic safety net.** `origine: "system"` was REMOVED on
        2026-09-08. It captured the previous value lazily, on the first write that
        changed it — which required having been declared BEFORE the row existed.
        Declared after the fact it caught nothing: 837 cells out of 846 lost on one
        campaign table, the owner's values already overwritten by agents.

        What replaces it is a DECLARED gesture, carried by the call that brings the
        data in: `donnees_d_origine=true`. It sets the FIRST version of the data (the
        origin) and marks the write as an import in the journal — the current value
        and the origin both go in at the moment the value enters, so there is
        no "before" and no "after" to get wrong. Three rules: an origin ALREADY set
        is never touched (a re-import updates the current value, never the origin) ;
        an EMPTY column receives nothing (supplying nothing is not supplying blank) ;
        the call's layers go into BOTH versions.

        So on a column whose origin was never captured, overwriting is FINAL in the
        row: only `data_row_history` still shows the previous value. The 28 799 `origine` layers already in the
        base are untouched — they are still read, served and protected; it is the
        mechanism that went, not the data.

        Re-writing the SAME value changes nothing and captures nothing, by design.
        And it does not depend on how the row was created: a row appended through
        the MCP tool and one created through the REST face behave identically
        (measured 2026-09-04, both faces call the same store).

        SINGLE (`row`): WITHOUT `id` = ADD a NEW row (new JSON keys auto-create
        columns, unless the table is CLOSED — see below); if the table declares a
        business `key` and your row carries a value that already exists, the
        business-key rule above applies. WITH `key=<the declared key>` = DESIGNATE the
        row by its key value: an existing value modifies that row and returns its
        `_id`, a new one creates it. WITH `id` = PARTIAL update of that row (only
        provided fields change). Returns the row
        (with `_id`/`_created_at`/`_updated_at`/`_revision`).

        `expected_revision` (with `id` only) — Only when what you write was COMPUTED
        from a row you read (a list or text you re-send whole, a status chosen from the
        current one): pass that read's `_revision`. If the row changed since — any
        column, or its reservation — nothing is written and the call is refused with
        `revision_conflict` and the current revision: read again, recompute, write
        again. Omit it otherwise: writes to different columns never overwrite each other.

        On a row you CLAIMED, address it by the `_id` of the row data_claim_next
        returned.

        BATCH (`rows` = list of dicts): write them all at once — for importing a
        dataset without round-tripping each row through your context. If a business
        KEY is in effect (the `key` arg, else the datastore's declared `schema.key`):
        with `key=` the batch DESIGNATES — a row whose key value exists modifies that
        row, a new value creates one; without `key=` it ADDS, and the business-key
        rule above applies to values already in the table. Two rows of the batch
        with the same key value follow that rule either way; rows without a key are
        appended. Returns a summary
        {inserted, updated, count, key, ids, fusions?} — `ids` holds one `_id` per row
        sent, rank for rank. Use `data_set_schema` to
        declare a persistent `key`. For a FILE, never retype its rows here: `oto_import`
        loads it from where it is (link, Drive, project file), `oto_upload_url` takes
        it from your disk.

        ⚠️ An error on the way BACK (expired session, dropped connection, timeout)
        does NOT mean the write failed: it may have committed before the error.
        Read the row back (`data_rows`, by `id` or filtered on its key) before
        re-sending.
        Re-sending is safe with `id`, or with `key=` (or `upsert=true`) on a table
        with a business `key`: the row is designated, or merged; a keyless append
        re-sent creates a DUPLICATE.

        ⚠️ A table can be CLOSED by its schema (`new_rows: "reject"`, next to its
        business `key`) — `data_get_schema` says whether it is. On such a table there
        is NO append at all: a write designating no existing row (no `id`, and no key
        value the table already carries) is REFUSED, single row and batch alike, and
        nothing is created — including a key value that is simply NEW. That is a
        deliberate setting of that table, not a platform rule. To make a row EXIST
        there, it is a schema move and not a write:
        `data_patch_schema(datastore=…, new_rows="create")`, your write, then
        `data_patch_schema(datastore=…, new_rows="reject")` to close it back.

        `origine_override=true` belongs to an IMPORT, not to a write of your own:
        it declares that this call knowingly sets the `origine` layer — refused
        without it. ⚠️ For a real import, prefer
        `donnees_d_origine=true`, which sets the first version (origin) in one gesture; the
        override only says "I know what I am doing on this layer".

        ⚠️ A COLUMN can be LOCKED by the schema (`readonly: true`) — it holds a
        value someone put there, and an ordinary write that CHANGES it is refused by
        name (writing the same value again is fine, and `<column>.comment` always
        stays open for what another source says). The lock holds what is SET, not
        what is missing: a cell with no value (key absent, `null` or `""`) can be filled
        once; `@empty` ("searched, nothing") IS a value, and clearing one (`null`)
        is a change. To REPLACE it anyway, pass
        `readonly_override=true` ON THIS CALL. It is open to the OWNER of the table
        (you, your org or your team) or to whoever GOVERNS it — a table merely SHARED
        with you in write is refused, by design. It applies to this one call and
        nothing else: there is no schema setting to reopen and therefore none to
        close back. Every forced replacement is written to the call journal (row,
        column, replaced value) next to who called. ⚠️ That journal entry is
        BOUNDED: at most 25 replacements per call, each value cut at 120
        characters (`…`, with `was_len`/`now_len` giving the original length). When
        it is cut short it says so (`readonly_forced_bilan`: "25 of N") — the count
        you read there is then a floor. The full history, whole values, is the row
        history: `data_row_history`.

        CHECK `notices` after a write: until the dates announced above, a column
        the schema does not declare, or a value its declared format refuses, is
        still WRITTEN and named there, dated — that is how you catch a renamed
        field you kept writing under its old name, or a value outside `options`.
        Absent = everything you wrote is in the declared format.

        ⚠️ The datastore must EXIST first (create it with `data_create_datastore`);
        writing to an unknown datastore raises "datastore inconnu" — it is NOT
        auto-created.

        ⚠️ **Address the table by its NUMBER.** The reply carries `ns_id` — the
        table's number — and that is the form to pass as `datastore`:
        `data_write(datastore=174, id=…)`. A name still resolves until 08/11/2026,
        then it is REFUSED.

        `datastore` also accepts `slot:<name>` = the table BOUND under that slot
        name by the ACTIVE project (procedures reference tables as <slot:name>;
        the project maps the name via its links). Requires an active project +
        the binding — otherwise an actionable error, never a fallback.

        Args:
            datastore: the table's NUMBER (`ns_id`, e.g. 174) — the form to use.
                Its name still resolves until 08/11/2026, then is refused.
                `slot:<name>` also works. It must already exist.
            row: single-row content as a dict (JSON-encoded automatically).
            id: omit = append a new row ; provided = partial update of that `_id`
                (the one data_write / data_claim_next returned for that row).
            expected_revision: with `id` only — the `_revision` of that row as you read
                it, when what you write was computed from that read (see above).
            force: force the NAMED columns on this call instead of everything it
                carries — `["raison_sociale", "raison_sociale.origine"]`. Naming
                them is enough; no need for `readonly_override` as well. ⚠️ It
                changes the SCOPE, not the right: forcing stays reserved to the
                table's owner or whoever governs it. A locked column absent from
                the list is refused normally, and the refusal says so.
            donnees_d_origine: sets the FIRST version of the data (the origin) and
                marks the write as an import in the journal: this call brings data
                AS THE CLIENT HANDED IT OVER. Each cell gets its `origine` version frozen at
                the same time as its current value, carrying the same layers, so
                `comment` says where the data came from. Use it for the import
                itself, NOT for enrichment: an agent's findings are the current
                version. An origin already set is never overwritten (a re-import
                updates the current version and leaves the origin alone), and an
                empty cell gets nothing — the client handed over nothing there,
                which is not the same as handing over an empty value.
            rows: BATCH mode — a list of row dicts written in one call.
            key: DESIGNATES rows by this business key column: an existing value
                modifies its row, a new one creates it — no `upsert` needed. BATCH
                (with `rows=[…]`): any column (default `schema.key`, but then the
                batch ADDS). Alongside a single `row`, accepted only when it names the
                table's DECLARED business key, `row` carries its value and no `id`
                is given; refused otherwise — wrap the row in `rows=[…]` to designate
                by another column.
            upsert: without `id` only. <<upsert>>
            readonly_override: `true` = overwrite the `readonly` columns THIS CALL
                writes, instead of being refused. Owner or governor of the table
                only ; valid for this call alone ; journaled.
            origine_override: IMPORT path only — declares that this call sets the
                `origine` layer knowingly (without it, such a write is refused).
                ⚠️ `origine: "system"` was removed on 2026-09-08:
                there is no longer a "formatted column". For a real import, prefer
                `donnees_d_origine`. This call only.
            layers: shape of the ROW this write returns (`flat` default, `nested`) —
                same as `data_rows`. Single row only.
            versions: which versions of each cell the returned row carries. Default:
                the current value only; the origin (the FIRST version of the data)
                is asked for with `versions=["current","origine"]`. Single row only;
                the reply states what it served in `versions_servies`.
            empties: how the returned row serves an assumed empty (`plain` default,
                `sentinel`) — same as `data_rows`. Single row only.

        """Atomically claim the NEXT unprocessed row of a datastore (work queue).

        Claim with `empties="sentinel"` when you will re-send a list: an assumed
        empty (written `@empty`, its reason in `comment`) then comes back
        `"@empty"` and, sent back as is, stays one; sent back as `""` it becomes an
        ordinary empty, refused on a required field. Never copy `@empty` into a
        deliverable.

        ⚠️ **Your `filter` MUST name a column your processing WRITES.** That is the
        one condition which makes the queue EMPTY, and nothing enforces it. The
        order: rows never served first, then the least recently served — a
        released row goes behind every fresh row, but it comes back once they are
        served, for as long as it still matches your filter.

        ⚠️ **How to see a queue running empty**: the row carries `_claims`. Above 1
        it means « you have already been served this row and it was not written »
        — that is the signature. Stop and re-read your filter;
        claiming again will not help.

        ⚠️ **A claim lives in a run.** Call `run_start` first and pass its
        `run_id` as `_run_id=` on this call: without an active run the claim is
        REFUSED and nothing is reserved — a row held outside a run could not be
        written, so you would research it for nothing.

        Write your result and release it by the `_id` of the returned row.

        ⚠️ **Address the table by its NUMBER, not its name**: the reply carries
        `ns_id` (e.g. `174`), the form to pass as `datastore` in every following
        call — `data_write(datastore=174, id=…)`, `data_release(datastore=174, …)`.

        The primitive for draining a table with N parallel (sub-)agents without
        collisions: picks, among rows whose claim lease is free or expired, the one
        served least recently (never-served rows first, then creation order),
        stamps `_claimed_by`/`_claimed_until` and returns it — two concurrent
        workers never get the same row. Returns `{row: null}` when nothing is
        left to claim.

        Filter on column A, write into column B, and the queue never empties:
        once the fresh rows are served, your own finished rows come back, round
        after round. Measured on a 3 766-row table, when the order was still
        « oldest first »: three workers filtered on a column the processing never
        touched. **834 fresh rows were never reached**, and one worker claimed the
        SAME row seven times. Every call succeeded and no error was raised — a
        livelock, not a failure, and you cannot see it from inside. Rows claimed
        again and again without a write end up set aside (the ceiling below) —
        LOST to the pass, without being at fault.

        A name still resolves as `datastore` until 08/11/2026 — then it is refused —
        but the number is what to carry: it survives a rename, it is unique where
        a name is only unique per owner, and it is what the platform records.
        `datastore` in the reply is the table's REAL name whatever form you passed
        in, so reading `"600"` back from a claim on `600` no longer happens.

        `worker` is a label YOU choose and REUSE verbatim on data_release — the
        guard so one agent cannot release another's claim.
        `filter` (exact {col: val}, e.g. {"status": "nouveau"}) selects what counts
        as claimable; it narrows the table's declared `lifecycle.claimable`, never
        widens it. The claim does NOT change the row: write your progress via
        data_write (id=…), then release it — writing a "final" status does not
        free it (#317). Release the row with `data_release` if you have it;
        otherwise finishing your run (`run_finish`) releases it. Never write your
        intent into the row (no `_action`/`_liberation` columns). The lease
        (`lease_s`, default 900s) only covers a worker that died. While you hold a
        row, nobody else can write it.

        Multi-pass table (`lifecycle.advance` declared): claim by the state of YOUR
        pass (`filter={"statut": "societe"}`), write your findings, release — the
        platform moves the row to the next state. Do not write that state yourself.

        The row carries `_claims` = how many times it has been claimed since the
        last successful write. A row claimed over and over WITHOUT a write is a
        queue running empty: past the ceiling — `lifecycle.max_claims` declared on
        the table, else a platform default of 3; `max_claims` here can only RAISE
        it for this pass — the server sets it aside: it stamps `_abandon` with the
        reason, ending with what the LAST attempt hit (the job's error, a refused
        write, the tools in error, or no write attempted) and `_abandon_run` with
        that attempt's run, moves it to `lifecycle.abandon_state` when the table declares a
        ceiling (with the default one its status is left untouched), and STOPS
        serving it — whatever your filter says. It stays readable and repairable:
        an explicit data_write puts it back in the queue and resets the counter.

        ⚠️ `layers="nested"` gives the row back in the SHAPE YOU WRITE — a cell
        that carries layers comes as `{"valeur": …, "comment": …}` instead of the
        flat pair `champ` + `champ.comment`. ⚠️ It stays a READ: do NOT send this
        row back. Write only the fields you established — and never
        `<field>.origine`, which is read here and set by the platform, never by an
        agent. The flat form shows a key with a DOT, and a dot does not look
        like a field name: agents turn `effectif.comment` into `effectif_comment`,
        which creates a ghost column — or, on a table that refuses unknown columns,
        loses the whole row. This is the only read that feeds a WRITE loop, so it is
        the one where the shape matters.

        Every column DECLARED in the schema is on the row, `null` when no value is in
        place — `null` means "nothing here yet": find it if your task needs it, never
        make it up. Sending such a `null` back changes nothing (a `null` only erases a
        value that is in place); still, write only the fields you established.

        `filters` is the LIST form — `[{field, op, value}]`, ANDed with `filter`.
        Use it when one column needs TWO bounds: `filter` accepts a single
        operator per column, so a range (`score >= 10 AND score <= 20`) can only
        be expressed here. Same grammar as `data_rows`.

        `datastore` also accepts `slot:<name>` (table bound by the active project).

        Args:
            datastore: the table's NUMBER (`ns_id`, e.g. 174) — the form to use.
                Its name still resolves until 08/11/2026, then is refused.
                `slot:<name>` also works. It must already exist.
            layers: shape of a cell that carries layers. `flat` (default): each
                filled layer beside the value (`email.comment`). `nested`:
                `{"valeur": …, "comment": …}`, the shape you write. Any other value
                is refused.
            empties: how an assumed empty (written `@empty`) comes back. `plain`
                (default): `""`, like any empty cell. `sentinel`: `"@empty"`, the
                word that writes it. Any other value is refused.

        of rows (`filter`/`q` narrow it, `order_by` sorts it) with a stable cursor.

        Read with `empties="sentinel"` before re-sending a list: an assumed empty
        (written `@empty`, its reason in `comment`) then comes back `"@empty"` — an
        ordinary `""` stays `""` — and, sent back as is, stays one; sent back as `""`
        it becomes an ordinary empty, refused on a required field.

        ⚠️ `datastore` = the table's NUMBER (`ns_id`, e.g. 174) — the form to use;
        the reply carries it back. A name still resolves until 08/11/2026, then
        is refused. `slot:<name>` also works.

        ⚠️ List mode returns `{rows, count, next_cursor, ns_id}`. When `next_cursor`
        is not null there are MORE rows: call again with `cursor=<next_cursor>`
        (same datastore/filter/order) — repeat until `next_cursor` is null. A page
        is not the table.

        `versions` picks which VERSIONS of each cell you get. By default, the current
        value only; the origin (the FIRST version of the data) is asked for with
        `versions=["current","origine"]`: `current` is what we established,
        `origine` what the client handed over.
        ⚠️ Ask for BOTH in ONE call when you compare them — two calls are not atomic,
        and an write in between would make you compare the before of one state with
        the after of another.

        Layers come back FLAT by default (`champ.origine` beside the bare name);
        `layers="nested"` returns the shape you write — guide `datastore-semantics`.
        The bare name ALWAYS carries the current version; `versions` only decides
        what is added beside it — at any depth: without `origine`, a list item
        carries no `item["email.origine"]` either. The reply states what it served in
        `versions_servies`, so "I did not ask for it" never looks like "this cell
        has none".
        The REST face `GET …/rows` pages by `offset` with a `total`, no cursor.

        Without `order_by` the cursor is keyset-stable (rows created meanwhile don't
        shift the paging). With `order_by` it pages by offset instead, since an
        arbitrary sort has no stable keyset — so a row inserted mid-walk can shift the
        remaining pages. `q` without `order_by` ranks the rows (best match first), so
        it pages by offset too. Keep the SAME `order_by` and `q` across a walk:
        passing a cursor from one regime into the other is rejected rather than
        silently mispaged.

        Use `count_only=True` to get just the TOTAL number of (optionally filtered)
        rows — computed server-side, no rows returned — when you only need the count
        (e.g. how many leads match a filter) without pulling the data into context.

        Use `fields` to PROJECT a subset of columns when the full row is heavy and you
        only need a few (e.g. name + email + score over a large vivier): each row is
        trimmed to those columns (plus `_id`, always kept so you can still update the
        row), drastically shrinking the payload. Bump `limit` when projecting — narrow
        rows let you pull far more per page.

        Every column DECLARED in the schema is on each row, `null` when no value is in
        place ("nothing here yet", not "no such column") — including in a projection.

        Args:
            datastore: target datastore, or `slot:<name>` = the table bound under
                that slot name by the ACTIVE project (actionable error if unbound).
            id: `_id` of one row ; omit = list rows.
            filter: dict `{column: value}` — exact match. A column may instead take
                ONE operator: `{"posted_at": {"gte": "2026-06-01"}}`,
                `{"author": {"contains": "sylvie"}}`, `{"status": {"ne": "processed"}}`,
                `{"idcc": {"in": ["573", "86"]}}`, `{"email": {"not_empty": true}}`.
                Ops: eq, ne, contains, in, gt, gte, lt, lte, empty, not_empty.
                The system columns are filterable too — `_updated_at`/`_created_at`
                (ops eq/ne/gt/gte/lt/lte; a plain `YYYY-MM-DD` means that WHOLE day,
                so `{"_updated_at": {"gte": "2026-08-01"}}` = touched since the 1st)
                and `_id`. Filtering happens in SQL — never pull the whole table to
                filter it yourself. (list mode only)
            filters: list of clauses, for what `filter` cannot express — ONE clause
                may target SEVERAL columns at once. A single notion often lives on
                numbered columns (`contact1_fonction`, `contact2_fonction`…): ask
                about all of them in one go by NAMING them.
                `[{"fields": ["contact1_fonction", "contact2_fonction",
                "contact3_fonction"], "op": "in", "value": ["DRH", "DAF"]}]`
                = rows where ANY of those three holds an HR/finance role, whichever
                rank carries it. `match` picks the sense: `any` (default, one column
                is enough) or `all` (every listed column) — `all` + `empty` is how you
                get "rows with NO contact at all", which is NOT the negation of the
                first. A clause may also name a single column (`{"field": …}`), and
                a `champ.origine`/`.comment`/`.link` suffix targets that layer.
                Clauses combine with AND, and with `filter`. (list mode only)
            q: <<recherche_q>> The way to find a row when you don't know WHICH
                column holds the word. Combines with `filter` (AND). (list mode only)
            q_scope: <<recherche_q_scope>>
            limit: page size (default 100, list mode only).
            cursor: opaque `next_cursor` from a previous call = fetch the NEXT page.
            fields: list of column names to keep (projection) — the returned rows
                carry only these plus `_id`; a declared one with no value comes back
                `null`. Omit = full rows.
            count_only: return only `{total}` (filtered row count), no rows.
            order_by: sort column — a user field, or a system one (`_created_at`,
                `_updated_at`, `_id`). Omit = creation order. Sorting in SQL is how
                you get "the 10 most recent" or "the top scores" without pulling the
                table and sorting it yourself. With `q` and no `order_by`, best
                matches come first. (list mode only)
                Sorting honors the DECLARED type of the column: a `number` sorts
                numerically (never "10 < 2"), an `enum` sorts in its declared
                option order, a `date` chronologically. Values that don't fit the
                type (junk in a number column, a value outside the enum's options)
                go to the TAIL in both directions, alphabetically; empty cells go
                last of all. When that happens the response carries
                `order_health: {off_type, empty}` — counts over the whole filtered
                set, absent when everything conforms.
            order_dir: `desc` (default) or `asc`. Meaningful with `order_by`; with
                `q` alone, it orders rows of EQUAL rank by creation.
            layers: shape of a cell that carries layers (`origine`/`comment`/`link`).
                ⚠️ This is a READ: do NOT send the row back. Write only the fields
                you established — and never `<field>.origine`, which is read here
                and set by the platform, never by an agent.
                You WRITE nested (`{"valeur": …, "comment": …}`) and, by default,
                read back FLAT — this parameter lifts that asymmetry. `flat`
                (default): `row["email"]` is the value, and each filled layer sits
                BESIDE it as `row["email.origine"]`. `nested`: `row["email"]` is
                `{"valeur": …, "origine": …, "comment": …, "link": …}` — `valeur`
                always, the other keys only when filled — i.e. the shape you WRITE
                with `data_write`. A cell without layers is the same plain value in
                both shapes. Any other value is refused. With `nested`, `fields`
                names columns (a nested cell keeps its layers); `email.origine` as
                a field name only exists in `flat`. The default WILL switch to
                `nested`, with dated notice: pass `layers` explicitly if you depend
                on one shape.
            empties: how an assumed empty (written `@empty`) comes back.
                `plain` (default): `""`, like any empty cell. `sentinel`:
                `"@empty"`, the word that writes it — top level, nested
                (`{"valeur": "@empty", …}`) and inside list elements alike. It is not
                a value: never copy it into a deliverable. Any other value is refused.

        """Aggregate rows SERVER-SIDE — stats over a whole (optionally filtered) table
        WITHOUT pulling the rows into context (feedback #191). Use this for totals and
        distributions over a large vivier (e.g. total kWc, average score, count per
        department) instead of reading 300+ rows and summing them yourself.

        `metrics` = list of `{op, field?}`; `op` ∈ count|count_rows|sum|avg|min|max
        (default `[{"op":"count"}]`). `count` without `field` = total rows;
        sum/avg/min/max require a numeric `field` and ignore non-numeric values.
        `group_by` = a column to group on (omit = one global row). Results are sorted
        by the first metric descending when grouped (so `group_by` gives you the TOP
        groups first).

        A metric may carry its OWN condition — `where`, same clauses as `filters` —
        so the total and a subset are counted in the SAME query. That is how you get a
        RATE without crossing two calls whose scopes can silently differ. Give such a
        metric a `label`, and it comes back under that name.

        `group_by` also accepts a LIST of columns: their values are POOLED, one row
        contributing one occurrence per filled column ("all ranks together"). Under a
        pooled group, `count` counts OCCURRENCES and `count_rows` counts ROWS — two
        different questions, so ask for the one you mean.

        A `list` column (e.g. `contacts`) is aggregated ACROSS ITS ITEMS with
        `contacts[].<attribute>`. `group_by: "contacts[].fonction"` makes every item of
        every matching row one occurrence — same vocabulary: `count` counts the
        contacts, `count_rows` the rows; a contact without that attribute falls in the
        `null` group. `filters` still select ROWS (a row kept by
        `contacts[].fonction eq DRH` contributes ALL its contacts). sum/avg/min/max
        with `field: "contacts[].<numeric attribute>"` aggregate over all items (read
        on the current item when grouping by the same list). A list path cannot be
        pooled with other columns, nor sorted; `contacts[0].x` targets one rank.
        A list of plain VALUES (e.g. `tags`) is read element by element with
        `tags[]`: `group_by: "tags[]"` counts each tag (`count`) and the rows carrying
        it (`count_rows`); `filters` on `tags[]` keep the rows holding the value.

        ⚠️ Pooling is NOT a two-dimensional group-by, and `group_by: "a,b"` is not one
        either — it is REFUSED (oto#50). A comma-separated string used to be read as a
        single column name containing a comma: no row carries it, so you got 200 with
        ONE group of key `null` holding every row, and no way to tell that from empty
        data. Group on one column per call, or pass the list if you meant to pool.
        Crossing two dimensions is not served yet.

        Returns `{results: [...]}` — each entry carries the `group_by` value (when set)
        plus one key per metric (`count`, `sum_<field>`, `avg_<field>`, or `label`).

        Examples —
            - total rows matching a filter: metrics omitted, filter={"statut":"qualified"}
            - MWc by department: group_by="departement",
              metrics=[{"op":"sum","field":"kwc_estime"}, {"op":"count"}]
            - share of companies with an HR contact on ANY rank, by headcount band —
              one call, no rows pulled:
              group_by="tranche_effectif",
              metrics=[{"op":"count","label":"fiches"},
                       {"op":"count","label":"avec_rh","where":[
                          {"fields":["contact1_fonction","contact2_fonction",
                                     "contact3_fonction"],
                           "op":"in","value":["DRH","DAF"]}]}]
            - which roles appear across all contact ranks:
              group_by=["contact1_fonction","contact2_fonction","contact3_fonction"]
            - the same on a `list` column, contacts and companies counted apart:
              group_by="contacts[].fonction",
              metrics=[{"op":"count"}, {"op":"count_rows"}]

        Visual variant of `data_url` that renders the data INLINE instead of just
        returning a dashboard link. WITHOUT `datastore` = a table of your
        datastores. WITH `datastore` = a sortable/searchable table of its rows,
        with an optional `filter` (same grammar as `data_rows`).

        Schema-aware (datastore v2, ADR 0046): a typed datastore renders its
        columns in the declared field order, and a SINGLE fiche is shown in a
        detail view — nested `object`/`list` fields (e.g. `contacts[]`, `signaux[]`)
        are expanded as sub-tables instead of a `"3 × {...}"` blob, and the
        `status` field shows its lifecycle (terminal / next allowed states). The
        detail view opens automatically when `filter` narrows to one row, or on
        demand with `row`.

        Use when the user wants to *see* and explore datastore content (e.g. a
        watch-list or a lead fiche) without leaving the chat. For raw JSON use
        `data_rows`; to edit a row, follow the dashboard link shown on the card.

        Args:
            datastore: target datastore ; omit = list all your datastores.
            filter: pre-filter rows, same grammar as `data_rows` — `{column: value}`
                exact match (e.g. `{"priorite": "P1"}`) or `{column: {op: value}}`
                with `op` in `eq`/`ne`/`contains`/`in`/`gt`/`gte`/`lt`/`lte`/
                `empty`/`not_empty` (e.g. `{"statut": {"in": ["actif", "clos"]}}`).
                An unknown operator is refused, never read as "no rows".
            row: open ONE fiche in detail view — matched against `_id`, the
                declared business key (`schema.key`), or the title field value.
            limit: max rows rendered (default 100).
