"""Google Drive — oto-core surface (DriveClient) exposed per-user, multi-account.

Management of the user's Drive files/folders: list, organize (move,
rename, folders), delete, share. **Full** `/auth/drive` scope
(restricted) — to see/manage ALL files, not only those created by
oto. Default account or targeted by `account`. Per-user via OAuth.

A LOCAL file's upload stays on the CLI side (no server FS) ; `op="upload"` deposits a
file REFERENCE oto resolves itself (`source`: http, url, project_file, drive…), and
can convert it to its Google-native type (an .xlsx becomes a Google Sheet, formatting
kept). READING is
fully exposed and diskless: `op="download"` for binary/uploaded files,
`op="export"` for Google-native ones (Docs/Sheets/Slides — their content
cannot be downloaded, it is converted). Both return the content to the agent
(inline text, or a signed URL for a binary). The "no FS" argument did not hold
for export: converting in memory writes nothing (signal #329 — without it,
impossible to ingest Gemini meeting notes other than by copy-paste).

**Consolidated surface (ADR 0047 §Amendment, applied to the `drive` product of the
`google` connector)**: one tool per business OBJECT, the verb as an `op` parameter —
`drive_file` (list/metadata/download/export/upload/create_folder/update/delete), all
scoped by the same file/folder (`file_id`) and the same `account`.
`drive_access` stays ALONE: its vocabulary (`email`/`role`/`remove`/`notify`)
is that of ANOTHER object — the permission — and overlaps no parameter of
`drive_file`. Merging it would put "change who sees this file" in the same
`op` enumeration as "delete this file": two irreversible gestures one
typo apart, for zero shared parameters.

⚠️ This module WRITES to the user's personal data. `op` defaults to `"list"`
(a READ): a call without `op` can neither delete nor modify. Missing required
arguments of an op raise an error naming the op and
the argument — never a silent fallback.

        `op`:
        - **"list"** (default): List Drive files. `folder_id` restricts to a parent
          folder id ; `query` = raw Drive query (e.g. "name contains 'report'",
          "mimeType='application/pdf'") ; `page_size` = max results (paginates).
          Returns {files: [{id, name, mimeType, modifiedTime, size, webViewLink}],
          count}.
        - **"metadata"**: Get a Drive file's metadata by id (`file_id`).
        - **"download"**: Fetch the CONTENT (bytes) of a Drive file, by `file_id`.
          Get `file_id` from op="list" / op="metadata". The response depends on
          the file:
          - **small text** (txt/csv/json/markdown, ≤256 KB) → returned INLINE:
            `{encoding: "text", content}` — read it directly.
          - **PDF** → its extracted TEXT returned INLINE: `{encoding: "text",
            format: "pdf-text", content, pages, truncated}` plus `raw_url` (+
            `raw_expires_in`), a short-lived signed URL to the original PDF
            (layout, images). A scanned or protected PDF has no text: it comes
            back as a URL, with `text_unavailable` saying why.
          - **binary or large** (image, archive, big file) → uploaded to temporary
            storage and returned as a short-lived signed URL: `{encoding: "url",
            url, expires_in}` (seconds). Fetch the URL to get the bytes.
          - **spreadsheet (.xlsx)** → returned INLINE as CSV, one section per
            sheet: `{encoding: "text", format: "csv", content, sheets,
            sheet_names, truncated}`. Each section starts with `# sheet=<index>
            name="…" rows_total=… rows_rendered=… truncated=…` then the CSV rows
            (computed values, not formulas; dates ISO 8601). All sheets by
            default, `max_rows` rows each (default 200, max 5000), size-capped:
            if `truncated`, ask one sheet with `sheet` and/or raise `max_rows`;
            the render always carries `raw_url` (+ `raw_expires_in`, seconds):
            a short-lived signed URL to the FULL original file, e.g. to load it
            into a table, store it or edit it with its formatting.
          For a Google-native doc (Docs/Sheets/Slides), this fails — read those
          with op="export" instead (they are converted, not downloaded). Returns
          {filename, mimeType, size, encoding, content|url, expires_in?}.
        - **"export"**: Read the CONTENT of a GOOGLE-NATIVE doc (Docs/Sheets/
          Slides), by `file_id`. The counterpart of op="download", which only works
          on uploaded/binary files: a Google-native doc has no binary content to
          download (403 "Only files with binary content can be downloaded"), its
          content comes out of an EXPORT — that's this op. Use it to actually READ
          meeting notes ("… - Notes par Gemini"), specs, or any Doc you found with
          op="list". `format` = markdown | text | html | pdf | csv | xlsx | pptx |
          docx ; omit it for a sensible default per type (Doc→markdown, Sheet→csv
          (first sheet), Slides→text). Returns {filename, mimeType, encoding,
          content|url, …}: text formats come back INLINE, `pdf` as its extracted
          text + `raw_url`. `xlsx` (a Sheet, every tab), `pptx` (a Slides deck) and
          `docx` (a Doc) are FILES, served as a signed URL: e.g. take a customer's
          deck as a `.pptx` template, build a new deck from it, and put that back
          with op="upload" convert=true.
        - **"upload"**: Deposit a file oto fetches itself from `source` (e.g.
          `{"kind": "http", "path": "/export.xlsx"}` through your `http` connector,
          `{"kind": "url", "url": …}`, `{"kind": "project_file", …}`) — the bytes
          never go through you. `name` = its name in Drive (the source's by default),
          `parent_folder_id` = its folder. `convert=true` turns it into its
          Google-native type, formatting kept: .xlsx/.xls/.ods/.csv → Google Sheets,
          .docx/.odt/.rtf/.txt/.html → Google Docs, .pptx/.odp → Google Slides ;
          another type is refused. Returns {id, name, mimeType, webViewLink}.
        - **"create_folder"**: Create a folder (`name`), optionally inside a parent
          folder (`parent_folder_id`). Returns the folder metadata.
        - **"update"**: Rename and/or move a file/folder. `new_name` = new name
          (rename) ; `move_to_folder` = destination folder id (move). You can do
          both at once ; at least one of the two is required.
        - **"delete"**: ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE — delete a file/folder (moves it to trash).
          Irreversible from the API's point of view.

        Sharing is NOT here: who can access a file is `drive_access` (list, grant
        or revoke), a separate tool on purpose.

                docx. Omit for a sensible default per type (Doc→markdown, Sheet→csv (first sheet),
                Slides→text).
            name: op="create_folder" — the folder name ; op="upload" — the file's
                name in Drive (the source's if omitted).
            parent_folder_id: op="create_folder"/"upload" — create it inside this
                folder.
            new_name: op="update" — new name (rename).
            move_to_folder: op="update" — destination folder id (move).
            sheet: op="download" of an .xlsx — the sheet to read, by name or
                0-based index (see `sheet_names`). Omit for all sheets.
            max_rows: op="download" of an .xlsx — rows per sheet (default 200,
                max 5000).
            source: op="upload" — the file reference oto fetches: `{"kind": "http",

                `{"kind": "project_file", "project_id": …, "file_id": …}`,
                `{"kind": "drive", "file_id": …}`. ≤ 25 MB.
            convert: op="upload" — true converts to the Google-native type.
            account: email of the Google account to use — same choice as `_account`.
