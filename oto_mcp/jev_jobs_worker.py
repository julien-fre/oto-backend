"""`jev_rows` background jobs (`jev_rows(background=true)`) — the loop that runs them.

A call judges what fits in its REST window (~100 rows); a job takes the whole table,
slice by slice, here, with no client connection to lose. Each tick claims the job that
waited longest and runs ONE slice of it (jobs take turns), then writes the slice's
counts and resume point back on the job.

**A slice runs AS ITS CALLER.** The sub, the org, the project and the run of the call
that queued the job are set again for every slice (`auth.hooks.sub_override`, the same
seam as « test a tool »), and `tools.jev.preparer` is called again under them: the write
right on the table, the shared key (a revoked grant), the model and the rubric are
re-checked before anything is sent, and every page re-resolves the key for its quota
(`client_partage(units=…)`). A paused account, a disabled tenant, a suspended org or a
member who left stops the job before its next slice.

**Billed per slice, in the same ledger as a call.** A slice is written to `tool_calls`
as a `jev_rows` MCP call (`kind='mcp'`, its own `call_uid`, the job's `run_id`), with the
spend and the key mode its trace collected — what the usage service reads. Per slice,
not per job: a credit cap must see the spend while the job runs.

**Resumable by construction.** Only undecided rows are taken (`model_column` empty), and
the cursor is written after every slice: a process killed mid-slice loses its lease,
and the next tick takes over from the last cursor. With `overwrite=true` that cursor is
what keeps rows from being judged (and billed) twice.

Acts on a third party (OpenRouter spends on the shared key): `tiers=True`, the
production drains the queue, preprod included (`boucles_de_fond.py`).
