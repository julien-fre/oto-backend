# reddit: reads posts/subreddits/comments WITH metrics (score,

# REST gateway. The official Reddit API is closed to self-serve
# (Responsible Builder Policy, late 2025) and anonymous JSON is blocked (403
# on datacenter IPs) → the old RSS connector (no metrics) is replaced.
# Shared platform key (Otomata pays for usage) + daily quota to bound the
# cost; BYO possible (the org sets its own redditapis key).
#
# ⚠️ THE PUBLISHER IS THE GATEWAY, NOT REDDIT (fixed on 2026-09-02). The listing
# used to announce "Reddit" as the publisher, with the reddit.com logo: we
# were attributing to Reddit a service Reddit does not provide — the call goes to
# api.redditapis.com, a reseller —, and the dependency on that intermediary
# appeared nowhere before installation. The NAME of the connector and of
# its tools does not change (callers depend on it): what changes is what
# the listing SAYS.
