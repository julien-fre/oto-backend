# `X-Jwt-Client-BoondManager` auth with THREE fields (`secret_kind="fields"`,
# resolved by `access.resolve_credential_fields`): the client signs a JWT per
# call with the `client_key`. `client_token` is declared NON-secret: it identifies
# the Boond account without signing anything. REST API access must be enabled in
# the Boond account, otherwise every call is refused.
#
# Strict BYOK (`byo_user` + `byo_org`): it is the customer's CRM, and every call
# consumes its MONTHLY Boond API quota.
