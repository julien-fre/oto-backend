# routine: trigger a Claude Code ROUTINE (autonomous agent hosted at
# Anthropic) through its `/fire` endpoint. oto does not run the agent — it
# triggers it, and the agent comes back on `/mcp` with its account's tools.
#
# ONE INSTANCE = ONE ROUTINE (ADR 0038 B5, same pattern as "one key × one
# workspace" at lighton): the `/fire` token is scoped by Anthropic to ONE
# routine, so one automation = one instance, revocable on its own and bindable to
# a project. A single token that triggered a catch-all routine
# would lose exactly the security notch that makes this path interesting.
#
# byo only: the routine belongs to a claude.ai account (it is not an org
# object on the Anthropic side, and what it does appears under that identity). No
# platform key: there is nothing to pool, each automation has its token.
