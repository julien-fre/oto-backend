DESCRIPTION = (
    "The company's accounting in Pennylane: quotes, invoices, customers, "
    "suppliers, bank transactions, trial balance, and the general ledger "
    "— read entries, post one, letter lines with each other. To be "
    "distinguished from `pennylaneged`, which gives access to the document store (GED) via "
    "a browser session rather than an API key. Permissions depend on the key "
    "set, not on the connector: each action requires its own scope."
