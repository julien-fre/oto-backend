# ONE card, TWO kinds of named entries (multi-account derived from `fields`):
#   · kind=api   — the Public API key (routines, search, Enterprise tables).
#     PERSONAL key on Clay's side (tied to a user and their credits).
#   · kind=table — the incoming webhook of ONE Clay table ("Monitor webhook" source),
#     the only WRITE path for rows into Clay. As many entries as tables;
#     the entry name is the table name the agent passes to `clay_push_rows`.
# `kind` lives in `meta` (`in_meta`): the tools list the tables and find
# the api entry WITHOUT decrypting. The discriminator hides the other kind's fields
# and `validate_fields` drops them on write.
# No endpoint creates a table webhook: it is copied from the Clay UI. The `webhook`
# field therefore accepts the URL OR the cURL command Clay displays (URL + token in
# a header), re-read by `oto.tools.clay.parse_curl` at resolution.
# byo only, no platform key: each call consumes the customer's Clay credits.
