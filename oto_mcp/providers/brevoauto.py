# brevoauto: automations (marketing workflows) via the vendor's PRIVATE API
# (`workflow-apis.brevo.com/v1`). Connector SEPARATE from the keyed `brevo` (public
# v3 API, further down) because the credential differs — browser session here, API key there;
# same vendor, two disjoint surfaces (the v3 key doesn't open automation
# authoring). Same split as pennylane / pennylaneged.
# Execution = **Browserbase** (hosted remote Chrome): the user logs in once via
# Live View (`brevoauto_connect_start`), their session persists in a Context = the
# per-user credential (vault). No browser on the box, no cookie export.
# personal_session (a session that is inherently per-user). Experimental (undocumented
# API): outside the base set, installable from the library.
