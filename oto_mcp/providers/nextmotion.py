# keyed api_key (Bearer), BYO only: a key acts on behalf of the
# user of the application that generated it, on the clinics where they are
# employed — a platform key would make no sense.
#
# ⚠️ Vendor of software that HOSTS HEALTH DATA. Medical content
# (history, photos, prescriptions, signed consents, treatments, consultations,
# visits, questionnaire answers) is NOT served; everything that goes out passes
# through an allowlist, so does everything that comes in, and every write is a preview
# (`dry_run`) unless told otherwise. The patient's identity is served
# only by `nextmotion_patient`; elsewhere the patient is just an id — see
# `tools/nextmotion.py`.
#
# Seven modules, one key: the tools of `nextmotion.py` and its siblings, mounted
# together by `modules`.
