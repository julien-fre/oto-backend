# gemini_image: images generated and edited by Google's Gemini image models ("Nano
# Banana"), from a prompt and up to fourteen reference images. A neighbour of
# `higgsfield` (images and clips) by situation: media production. The client lives in
# the connector library (`oto.tools.gemini.GeminiClient.create_image`), the tools in
# `tools/gemini_image.py` (the pair `gemini_image` reads, `gemini_image_act` acts).
#
# keyed `api_key`: an AI Studio key, sent in the `x-goog-api-key` header. A free-tier
# project has NO image quota (Google answers 429 with `limit: 0`): billing must be on.
#
# BYO (user OR org: the customer's own Google billing) or a platform key on explicit
# grant (`platform_key_open=False`, `default_quota=0`: an org without a grant never
# reaches it). The call is synchronous and Google's answer counts the tokens it used:
# on the platform key the grant's quota is checked for the call's BOUND (published
# per-image price, plus a thinking allowance) before anything is sent, and the call
# notes what it actually cost (`units`, `quantity`, in micro-dollars). Every grant
# carries a daily quota in those micro-dollars (`grant_quota_unit`): the default, 0,
# would be unlimited on our billing. The platform key serves only the models priced in
# `tools/gemini_image.py::PRICES`.
