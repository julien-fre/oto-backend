# Multi-auth HTTP client: unlike the bridge, oto HOLDS the target API's
# secret (AES vault, byo_org) and calls the API directly (no remote
# service). `auth_mode` discriminates the mode (bearer/header/query/basic/oauth2/
# none); the required secret fields depend on the mode (validated at call-time by
# oto_http.build_auth).
# TO BE DISTINGUISHED from the bridge (credential outside the platform): here the key
# is entrusted to oto — no custody on the client side.
#
# ⚠️ This comment announced "read-only (GET), anti-SSRF guard on
# the host" until 2026-08-27 — TWO false claims (oto-backend#449): the
# connector also carries `http_post`, and no SSRF guard existed. The second
# was then presented as intentional, on the grounds that the platform's egress
# filtering compensated; it only blocks one range (link-local), loopback
# and private ranges remained reachable. The guard now exists
# in the code — `oto_mcp/egress.py`, called by `tools/http.py:_client()` —
# and a legitimate internal destination is declared as a NAMED exception.
# CLOSED set of auth modes. COPIED from `oto.tools.http.AUTH_MODES` — not imported:
# the registry stays pure (no module-level runtime dependency, otherwise a missing
# dep would remove the connector from the catalog instead of degrading it). The copy is
# held by the `test_http_auth_modes.py` tripwire, which compares it to oto-core AND checks
# that the fields declared required per mode are EXACTLY the ones `build_auth` requires.

# Publisher: the connector is OURS, and there is no intermediary to name — oto
# holds the secret and calls DIRECTLY the API the org configured (no remote
# service). The host called is the `base_url` of each credential: it does not exist
# at the registry level, and nothing passes itself off as something else. DECLARED, not derived
# from a default: since 2026-09-02 there is none (`Connector.publisher_name`).

DESCRIPTION = (
    "Connect any HTTP API to oto by entrusting its secret to the vault "
    ": fill in the base URL, choose the authentication mode (bearer, "
    "header, query, basic, OAuth2 or none), and the agent calls it via GET or "
    "POST. Useful for an internal API or a third-party service without a dedicated connector "
    "— the key stays with oto, unlike a bridge where the third party keeps "
    "its own."
