# forager : job posts + firmographics + people/contact enrichment, billed
# per credit per lookup. Auth = flat `X-API-KEY` header (a single secret),
# but NOT `secret_kind="api_key"`: every datastorage call also needs an
# integer `account_id` in the path, resolved at runtime via `GET
# /api/users/current/` → `accounts[]` — hence the multi-field model (ADR
# 0011, `secret_kind="fields"`) even though the secret itself is a plain
# bearer, to carry that second (non-secret) field. `account_id` is
# OPTIONAL: `ForagerClient` resolves it on its own if the key only has access
# to one account, and REFUSES (instead of guessing) if it has several —
# guessing could bill the wrong account. BYO (the customer's paid account) or a
# platform key on explicit grant. The platform key serves ONE lookup — a
# person's phone numbers (`tools/forager.py::PLATFORM_OPS`); every other op asks
# for the customer's own key. No API key management tool (create/delete) —
# dashboard-only, see tools/forager.py.
