# unipile: hosted LinkedIn (search/scrape/messaging) via the Unipile API.
# The LinkedIn session lives at Unipile (real Chrome + residential proxy) →
# sidesteps TLS fingerprint + session isolation of the local browser (#5). Keyed
# api_key (resolved via resolve_api_key, cascade user > org). byo_user (BYO) OR
# byo_org (the org sets up the Otomata subscription, its members connect their LinkedIn
# via hosted-auth). Outside the base set (like the whole catalog, 16/07); the paid option
# (layer 3) gates platform usage, BYO stays free. The **dsn** (API v2:
# gateway `api.unipile.com`) comes from the BYO credential's `meta`; the platform key
# takes the oto-core client's default (api.unipile.com), which reads no env — NOT a
# credential field as long as a BYO
# on another endpoint doesn't exist (deferred; single-field = compatible with the existing
# org-secret storage, single-valued).
# ⚠️ Namespace of the LinkedIn tools = `linkedin_unipile` (multi-token), not `unipile`:
# ADR 0010 §Amendment 2026-08-10 — the namespace carries the CAPABILITY, suffixed with the
# PROVIDER when several non-substitutable providers render it (here Unipile,
# operated session · AI Ark, purchased data). `namespace_of` resolves to the longest prefix
# DECLARED here: both therefore keep a distinct gate. `unipile` stays declared for
# `unipile_connect_start` (multi-channel: linkedin|whatsapp|… — it belongs to no
# capability, its target place is `oto_connector op=connect`, see oto-backend#279).

            href: str, modules: tuple[str, ...] = ()):
    """Registry entry of ONE hosted channel — six connectors, a single shape.

    Each channel has its home (`providers/<name>.py`) and declares there what
    DISTINGUISHES it: its name (= its tools namespace), its Unipile channel, its label,
    its brand. What it shares with the other five — the auth modes, the credential
    delegation, the per-person nature — is described HERE, at the key holder,
    because it's a property of the ACCOUNT and not of the channel.
    Copying these flags six times means giving ourselves five chances to make them
    diverge.

    The channel OWNS nothing: `credential_of="unipile"` points vault, quota, platform
    key and layer-3 option to the account. What it owns itself is
    what is governed per channel — activation, ACL, selection, tool visibility,
    and its hosted connection (one flow per card, no parameter).

    ⚠️ `platform_key_open` is NOT copied: it governs the SHARING of a platform
    key and is read on the holder, after normalization by the cascade. Setting it
    on a channel would be dead configuration that the next reader would
    take for live — the exact shape of the all-users outage of #245.
    `personal_cross_org`, ON THE OTHER HAND, is copied: `call_axes` resolves by NAMESPACE, and
    it's this flag that makes the `_account=` axis exist on the channel's tools
    — hence the granted accounts (#55). The two don't answer the same question.

    `href` is that of the channel's BRAND, never the provider's: what the
    person connects is their LinkedIn or their WhatsApp.

    ⚠️ `publisher` is the ONLY field of the card that names the provider, and its
    definition requires it: the publisher names **who receives the call**
    (`docs/connector-vault.md` §"What the card SAYS", 2026-09-02). A
    `whatsapp_chat(op=send)` goes to Unipile, which holds the operated account's
    session — the message is sent BY a third-party gateway. Until 2026-09-02
    these six cards fell back on the default "Otomata": we were attributing the
    sending to ourselves. It's declared HERE, in a single copy, because it's a property of the
    ACCOUNT (like the key, the quota, the option) and not of the channel — copying it six
    times would mean giving ourselves five chances to make it diverge. Same shape as
    `reddit` → `redditapis.com`: the gateway is named, the brand keeps the
    label, the logo and the `href`.

    ⚠️ **And each channel's `help` says it TOO, in one clause.** The publisher is not
    enough: the catalog block injected at the handshake only serves `"label : help"`
    — not the publisher — and the help is what one reads BEFORE installing. All six got
    it on 2026-09-02 (`docs/connector-vault.md`: "the help says that an intermediary
    exists, in one clause and without jargon"). **Same shape for all six**, and a channel
    added tomorrow must have it too: ratchet in `tests/test_unipile_split.py`."""
