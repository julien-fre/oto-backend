# depth; this one serves the opposite need — reading N sites (paid media,
# intranet, back-office without API) without a dev cycle per site. **Multi-account**:
# one vault account = one site (host), hence one Browserbase Context per site
# (isolated sessions, cf. `cardinality`). byo_user: a logged-in session
# is physiologically personal. Outside the base, installable from the library;
# `browser_eval` (arbitrary JS) stays hidden by default (DEFAULT_HIDDEN_TOOLS).
