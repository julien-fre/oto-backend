"""The MODEL of a connector — the shape, never the content.

`CredentialField`, `Connector` and the `_c` factory live here; the ~90 entries
that instantiate them each live in `providers/<name>.py`, and
`providers/__init__.py` AGGREGATES them. Keeping the two apart avoids the import
cycle that a model defined in the aggregator and imported by the declarations
would create.

PURE module: no `oto_mcp` import at module level (the properties that need
curated data — `doc_sections`, `category`, `description`,
`publisher_name`, `logo_url_for` — import it LAZILY from the aggregator,
never at import time).

Each connector carries the 3 axes of the platform model:
- **A. Availability**: `availability` (self_serve | platform_granted). platform_granted
  = grant-only (the platform grants explicitly, e.g. a connector reserved for one customer).
- **B. Visibility**: `default_active` (curated BASE SET, ADR 0050 — installed by default
  in the selection of a new (sub, org); the rest of the catalog = installable
  library). Policy, tunable.
- **C. Credential**: `auth_modes` ⊆ {byo_user, byo_org, platform}; `keyed` (resolved via
  `resolve_api_key` with an api key); `secret_kind`; `personal_session` (session
  that is physiologically per-user: linkedin/google/slack/whatsapp/crunchbase, never org).

        INSTALLATION in a workspace (N installations = N independent tokens) —
        a rule gap, not a provider reason. Setting a 2nd account there
        wrote a row that the resolution would never read (oto-backend#409).

        Out of scope, deliberately: OAuth/cookie/none (N accounts = N
        consents, a different problem), hosted/remote (no key to set), and
        `personal_cross_org` connectors (unipile), whose cross-org rung
        of the cascade is single-account by construction. A case that
