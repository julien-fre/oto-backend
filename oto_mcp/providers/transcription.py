# transcription: a project audio file becomes a project page (ADR 0074). The
# provider is Mistral (Voxtral); the connector carries the VERB, not the brand —
# `mistral` already exists as a key carrier WITHOUT a tool (`kind="credential"`, scheduled
# agents), and a tool connector does not graft onto it.
#
# `byo_org` + `platform`: the key is the organization's (it is the one paying for the
# audio minute) OR a platform instance granted to an org (the org without
# its own key, e.g. a pilot: the key, language and vocabulary are then those of the
# platform instance). The org that has its own instance takes precedence over the platform
# (cascade). MONO-account, declared: a call
# transcribes with ONE key and ONE vocabulary, and two instances set on the same org
# would have no criterion to tell them apart — attaching to a project goes through
# a slot (ADR 0035), like any instance.
#
# Two NON-secret fields make the instance "one key × one language × one
# vocabulary" (ADR 0074 D1):
# - `language`: language code, `fr` when it is empty; `auto` = detection by
#   the upstream;
# - `vocabulary`: business terms entered by hand, separated by commas or
#   line breaks — the space is SIGNIFICANT there (« pompe à chaleur »), hence
#   `whitespace_significant`: the default cleanup would strip all blanks.
