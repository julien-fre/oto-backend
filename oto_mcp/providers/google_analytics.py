# google_analytics: GA4 in READ mode, via a SERVICE ACCOUNT KEY — not via
# the OAuth of the `google` connector. A user's consent to the
# `analytics.readonly` scope is blocked by Google for our application (observed on
# 25/09/2026); a service account added as a Viewer of a GA4 property
# reads without anyone's Google account, and is cut off by removing its access.
#
# ONE secret field: the key's JSON file, whole (`secret_kind="fields"`,
# resolved by `access.resolve_credential_fields`). ⚠️ `whitespace_significant`:
# the PEM private key contains spaces ("BEGIN PRIVATE KEY") — the default cleanup,
# which strips ALL whitespace, would make it unreadable. Only the edges
# are stripped.
#
# byo_org first: the founding case is an org whose agents ALL read the
# same property, without copying the key to each (org instance). byo_user stays
# open for a person with their own service account. Outside the base set →
# installable on demand. Namespace `ga4`, the name the agent reads in its
# tools; the connector keeps the product name.
