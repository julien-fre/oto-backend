# github: repositories and code, issues, pull requests, organizations and Actions.
# Dev category, next to `posthog` and `supabase`.
#
# **Two fields, a single secret.** The token, and a NON-secret `base_url` that
# only exists for GitHub Enterprise Server (`https://<host>/api/v3`) — left
# empty, it is `api.github.com`. It is declared here rather than guessed, because
# an on-premise customer cannot use the connector without it,
# and a second "github enterprise" card would have duplicated everything else.
#
# ⚠️ **What the token can do is NOT readable from this card**: a classic
# token carries *scopes* (`repo`, `read:org`, `workflow`…), a "fine-grained"
# token carries permissions AND a repository list. The connector
# can neither verify them at setup nor widen them — the connection probe
# therefore reports what the token SEES, and that is all we can promise.
#
# ⚠️ Diagnostic trap to know before reading a support ticket: on a
# private resource outside the token's reach, GitHub answers **404, not 403**, on purpose
# so as not to disclose its existence. "Repository not found" therefore almost always
# means "token without the right", not "misspelled name".
#
# Strict BYOK (`byo_user` + `byo_org`, no platform mode): a GitHub token
# carries its holder's identity — every commit, every comment, every
# merge is attributed to THEM. A shared oto key would sign an org's writes
# in the name of an account that is not its own, which makes no sense here.
# Multi-field, hence `secret_kind="fields"` and **not** `keyed`: resolution
# goes through `access.resolve_credential_fields` (pure byo, no platform tier
# or quota), exactly like `posthog` — same shape, a secret plus a non-secret
# instance setting. `keyed=True` would go through `resolve_api_key`, which
# only returns ONE value and would lose the `base_url`.
