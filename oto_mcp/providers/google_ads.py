# Google Ads: the person authorises THIS service on their Google account, from this
# card (scope `adwords`); reads see exactly the Google Ads accounts THEIR Google user
# can open. No developer token: since 2026-09-09 Google ignores it, and the API
# access level (test / explorer / basic / standard) is the one of the Google Cloud
# project that owns the OAuth client — an instance setting, not a customer field.
# Read-only is enforced by the oto-core client (`oto.tools.google.ads`): the scope would
# allow mutating, no mutate endpoint is ever built.
