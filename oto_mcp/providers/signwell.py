# signwell: electronic signature — documents sent for signature, templates,
# bulk sends, webhooks (26 operations, full coverage of the public API).
# The client lives in oto-core (`oto.tools.signwell`), the tools in
# `tools/signwell.py` (documents, templates) and `tools/signwell_envois.py` (bulk
# sends, webhooks, account).
#
# **byo-only, by nature**: a SignWell key acts on behalf of the account that created it —
# that name is what appears on the invitations and in the audit trail of the signed
# document. A platform key would send contracts in someone else's name.
#
# ⚠️ SENDS to real people: a sent document, a reminder, a bulk send
# go out by email. The tools create a DRAFT by default, and a bulk
# send is a preview until `dry_run=False` is passed.
