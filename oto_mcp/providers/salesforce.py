# salesforce: OAuth2 Connected App → multi-field credential (ADR 0011, like
# zoho), resolved via resolve_credential_fields. byo_user OR byo_org (sales
# team shares a Connected App). No fixed region table: the Salesforce refresh
# returns the `instance_url`, `login_url` only selects prod vs sandbox
# (or a My Domain).
# salesforce: no more hand-set `refresh_token` — the live OAuth flow
# (salesforce_oauth.py) is now the ONLY way to obtain it. The
# form only collects the client_id/client_secret/login_url triplet;
# "the consent remains" is expressed via `status_hints` (register_state +
# pending_action, declared in tools/salesforce.py) — NOT via a separate auth
# method: the `auth_method` set is closed and read by a dashboard switch. The
# `client_id`/`client_secret` remain PER-CUSTOMER (each org creates its
# own Connected App) — no shared Otomata client possible here,
# unlike google (see salesforce_oauth.py).
