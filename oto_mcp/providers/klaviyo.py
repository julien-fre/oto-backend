# klaviyo: email & SMS marketing — the customer relationship side of the API:
# account, profiles, lists, segments, campaigns, flows, metrics, events,
# metric aggregates and the campaign / flow values reports (read); profiles,
# list membership, events and marketing consent (write). NOTHING sends a
# campaign or creates/edits a campaign, flow or template.
# The client lives in the connector library (`oto.tools.klaviyo`), the tools in
# `tools/klaviyo.py` (account, profiles, lists, segments, consent) and
# `tools/klaviyo_marketing.py` (campaigns, flows, metrics, events, reports); the
# shared base in `tools/klaviyo_socle.py`.
#
# **byo-only, by nature**: a private key belongs to ONE Klaviyo account and
# carries the scopes chosen when it was created (they cannot be edited
# afterwards). A platform key would read and write someone else's customers.
#
# ⚠️ Four writes may reach real people: adding profiles to a list and recording
# an event start the flows they trigger; subscribing changes consent (and a
# double opt-in list emails a confirmation); unsubscribing without a list is
# global. The tools return a PREVIEW for those until `confirm=True`.
