#
# **Basic** auth with TWO fields (`api_id` + `api_token`), hence `secret_kind="fields"`
# and resolution via `access.resolve_credential_fields`. A key is created in the
# Aircall Dashboard (Company Settings → API Keys) by an admin account, and gives
# access to the whole company: no finer scope on Aircall's side.
#
# `api_id` is declared NOT secret: it identifies the key that was set without exposing the
# token that goes with it (same split as `leexi` between its KEY_ID and its secret).
#
# Strict BYOK (`byo_user` + `byo_org`, no platform mode): these are the calls
# and recordings of the customer company.
