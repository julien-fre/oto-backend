# planity: a salon's calendar + till, NATIVE (kind=tools). The connector
# authenticates with the Planity account's email and password, stored in the vault
# (`basic_auth`, member tier). The client lives in oto-core
# (`oto.tools.planity`), the tools in `tools/planity*.py` — the `planity_*` names
# and their schemas have not changed (agents and the listing know them); the
# additions of 2026-09-09 are additive.
#
# ⚠️ This connector was `kind="mount"` until 2026-09-09: the same tools
# were served by a standalone MCP server that we operated, to which the backend
# replayed the vault's `basic_auth` per request. The stored format and the
# credential do not change one iota — what changes is that there is no longer an
# intermediary to operate, hence no gateway left to announce in the listing.
#
# ⚠️ THE PUBLISHER IS US (corrected on 2026-09-02). The listing used to announce
# "Planity" as publisher, with the planity.com logo: it read as an official
# integration, whereas the connector is OURS and it authenticates with the user's
# Planity email and password — the heaviest commitment the listing makes, and one
# that was missing from it.
