"""Registry declaration of the `google` connector — the Google ACCOUNT, carrier of the
credential for the six service connectors (split of 2026-09-26).

Sole home of its entry: `providers/__init__.py` AGGREGATES it (it does not
describe it). See `providers/_model.py` for the `Connector` contract.

Until the split, `google` carried six namespaces (gmail, tasks, calendar, sheets,
drive, chat): ONE card, ONE activation, ONE consent that requested all six
scopes at once — three of them RESTRICTED at Google (Gmail, Drive, Chat). A tenant
offering only Gmail and Drive still had to get Chat and Tasks verified, and a
user who only wanted their calendar handed over their mailbox. Same move as
the unipile split of 2026-08-28: each service is now a connector in its own
right — its card, its activation, its selection, its visibility, ITS consent
(its scopes only, as incremental authorisation on the same account) — and
borrows the account from here (`credential_of="google"`, see `service` below).

What the account keeps for itself: the vault (one row per address, the refresh
token, the OAuth client that issued it), the `/api/google/oauth/callback` callback, the
list of accounts and the default account. Its own consent requests all six
scopes under OUR app (the prior state, for a single-card dashboard) and
only the identity under a tenant's app — a partner never requests a
scope its Google project does not declare; its services add them one by one
(`auth/google.scopes_for`).

    what is governed per service — activation, selection, visibility of its tools — and
