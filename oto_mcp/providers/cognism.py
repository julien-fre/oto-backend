# (developers.cognism.com). Synchronous REST client in oto-core
# (`oto.tools.cognism`), curated tools in `tools/cognism.py`. Standard key
# cascade (`resolve_api_key`) — BYO org covers the "one key for the whole
# org" need; "platform" mode GRANT-ONLY since 26/08 (#405, credits GTM —
# this doc said the opposite until then, for lack of an Otomata↔Cognism commercial agreement).
# search_contacts/search_accounts = preview only (`has*` flags, no real
# email/phone); redeem_contacts/redeem_accounts = full reveal
# (consumes credits); enrich_contact/enrich_account = lookup by
# identity (email/LinkedIn/name+company). Filter DSL (~150 fields)
# documented in the `cognism-filters` guide, not in the tool docstrings.
