# ⚠️ **Two Instagram connectors, and the name says which.** `instagram` (without
# suffix) is the account's MESSAGING, operated by Unipile; this one is the
# STATISTICS, served by Meta's official API ("Instagram API with Instagram
# Login"). They are not substitutable: not the same source, not the same
# credential, not the same rights — this is exactly the case ADR 0010
# §Amendment of 2026-08-10 names, "the namespace carries the CAPABILITY, suffixed with the
# PROVIDER when several non-substitutable providers deliver it", and of which
# `linkedin_unipile_*` / `linkedin_aiark_*` is the precedent.
#
# `tool_visibility.namespace_of` resolves to the longest DECLARED prefix: an
# `instagram_meta_get_profile` therefore lands on THIS connector and not on the other —
# call gate, ACL, selection and visibility remain distinct. Locked by
# `tests/test_instagram_meta_natif.py`.
#
# ⚠️ The symmetry is imperfect and stays so: the doctrinal pair would be
# `instagram_unipile` / `instagram_meta`. Renaming the existing one would break a contract
# consumed OUTSIDE this repo (`instagram_chat` is called by procedures in the database
# and by guides) — which is the very reason the Unipile split of
# 2026-08-28 touched no tool name. We add the suffix to the newcomer,
# we do not retrofit it onto the old one.
#
# ⚠️ **Without Meta's App Review, this connector only serves accounts INVITED
# as testers on our application.** This is not a code limit: it is the
# regime of unpublished Meta apps. A person who signs up alone
# gets a refusal at consent, and that is what the card announces BEFORE and
# what the error message names AFTER.
