# (WordPress ≥ 5.6, HTTP Basic over HTTPS) — no plugin to install.
# Three fields, like n8n: the site is self-hosted, there is no single host
# (`site_url` goes through `egress.check_url`). Two ways to set the same
# credential: the form (paste the password) or the "Connect" flow
# (`tools/wordpress.py`, WordPress's native authorization screen,
# `wp-admin/authorize-application.php`) which fills it in without copy-paste.
# Derived multi-account (`fields`): one account = one site — an agency manages ten.
