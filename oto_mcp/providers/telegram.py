# `telegram_chat(op=list|read|send)` acts under that identity. Derived from the shared
# messaging factory (`tools/unipile.register_messaging_tools`) — the provider's
# `/chats` API is channel-agnostic, the channel of the operated account decides the

# The card does not name our provider: what we connect is a Telegram account.
# The provider account (the key) is a separate connector, `unipile`.
