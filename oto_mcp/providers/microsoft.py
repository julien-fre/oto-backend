"""Registry declaration of the `microsoft` connector — the Microsoft 365 ACCOUNT, carrier
of the credential for the Microsoft service connectors.

Sole home of its entry: `providers/__init__.py` AGGREGATES it (it does not
describe it). See `providers/_model.py` for the `Connector` contract.

Same shape as the Google account (`providers/google.py`): each Microsoft service —
SharePoint & OneDrive today, Outlook, Outlook Calendar and Teams in the next lots — is
a connector in its own right (its card, its activation, its selection, ITS consent:
its scopes only, added to the same Entra consent of the account) and borrows the
account from here (`credential_of="microsoft"`, see `service` below).

What the account keeps for itself: the vault (one row per linked Microsoft account,
the refresh token, the directory it signs in to), the `/api/microsoft/oauth/callback`
callback, the coordinates of oto's Entra application (`connector_settings`, platform
scope), the list of accounts and the default account. Its own consent requests the
identity only: each service adds its scopes from its card (`auth/microsoft.scopes_for`).
The application is oto's own, multi-tenant: the client registers none. The Graph
host is fixed: no egress guard to set.
