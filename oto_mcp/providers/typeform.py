# typeform: online forms — workspaces, forms (read, create, patch, replace,
# delete), responses (read, summary, delete), webhooks. byo (user OR org),
# resolved via `resolve_credential_fields`: a personal token acts in the name of
# its creator and carries ITS scopes, no shared platform key. A read-only token
# keeps every read; a write it lacks the scope for is refused by Typeform (403),
# and the tool names the scope.
# TWO fields: the token, and the account's region. Typeform has three hosts (one
# per data center) and an account's RESPONSES can only be read in its own:
# elsewhere, the list comes back empty without error. The region is DECLARED at setup,
# closed set (`choices`) — never a free URL, hence no typed-in destination.
# Three tool modules, by object (the 500-line cap): the base and the responses,
# the forms, the webhooks.
