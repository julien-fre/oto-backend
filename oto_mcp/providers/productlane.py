# productlane: customer feedback (threads, contacts, companies), public roadmap
# and help center. Neighbor of `linear` — same "Business apps" category — and it is not
# just a thematic kinship: **Productlane's roadmap IS backed by Linear**.
# Projects and issues are created in Linear first, then mirrored here. An org
# that has both connectors therefore sees the same objects through two doors, and that
# is normal.
#
# ⚠️ **v2** API (`/api/v2`, Bearer). A v1 key does not work: v1 is a separate
# API, which shuts down on 2026-11-20.
#
# BYO org first (customer feedback belongs to the organization, not to one
# person), but `byo_user` stays open: the key is created per member on the
# Productlane side, and an org that is starting out often sets up its PM's before
# turning it into a team key. No platform mode — these are the org's
# customer conversations.
