# aiark: classic connector (kind="tools", ex-federated MCP #152 → requalified
# #160). Synchronous REST client in oto-core (`oto.tools.aiark`), curated tools
# in `tools/aiark.py` (LLM contract), standard key cascade
# (`resolve_api_key`) + `record_platform_usage` → platform mode possible.
# v1 = synchronous endpoints (company/people search, single-person export+email,
# reverse-lookup, mobile phone); AI Ark's bulk exports are async
# (webhook) → out of scope.
# ⚠️ Tools namespace = `linkedin_aiark` (ADR 0010 §Amendment 2026-08-10):
# the name carries the CAPABILITY (LinkedIn) suffixed by the PROVIDER, because two
# NON-SUBSTITUTABLE providers deliver it — AI Ark = data BOUGHT per credit
# (no connected account), Unipile = the OPERATED session (`linkedin_unipile_*`).
# `namespace_of` resolves to the longest declared prefix: the two keep a
# distinct gate. The connector, for its part, keeps the provider's name — it is the unit
# of activation and credential.
# **Absorbs the former `linkedin` connector** (#231, dropped on 2026-08-10,
# oto-backend#279): same vendor, same `AiArkClient` client, same 5 functions —
# it differed only by the auth mode (`platform` only vs BYO), which is
# an INSTANCE distinction (ADR 0038/0044 §F), not a connector one. The duplicate
# cost setting the same key TWICE for a single vendor credit pool
# (ADR 0024: each connector resolves ITS name). The "offered by oto" packaging
# survives as is: it is the platform grant on `aiark`. Nothing to migrate on the
# vault side — no grant had been set under `linkedin`, whose 5 tools had been
# mounted and inoperative since going live.
