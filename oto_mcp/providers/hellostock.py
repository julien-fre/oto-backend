# hellostock: the ADMINISTRATION API of the HelloStock marketplace (requests,
# offers, members, positionings). The client lives in oto-core
# (`oto.tools.hellostock`), the tools in `tools/hellostock.py` (reads) and
# `tools/hellostock_ecritures.py` (the three actions that act on the
# production marketplace).
#
# **byo_user only, by nature**: the credential is a PERSONAL TOKEN created by
# each user in their HelloStock account, which carries THEIR rights — and these
# routes require an administrator account. An org or platform key would be
# a named account lent to others, traced under the name of someone who did not act
# (a request send is recorded under the name of the admin whose token it is).
#
# ⚠️ WRITES and SENDS: `hellostock_demande_send` goes out by email to real
# members (dry-run BY DEFAULT), `hellostock_demande_set_status` and
# `hellostock_offre_update` modify what the public marketplace displays.
