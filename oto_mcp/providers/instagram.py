# Instagram: the person connects THEIR account through a hosted flow, and the tool
# `instagram_chat(op=list|read|send)` acts under that identity. Derived from the
# shared messaging factory (`tools/unipile.register_messaging_tools`) — the provider's
# `/chats` API is channel-agnostic, it is the operated account's channel that decides
# the route.

# The card does not name our provider: what is being connected is an Instagram
# account. The provider account (the key) is a separate connector, `unipile`.
