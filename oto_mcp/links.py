"""The links we give a user — and what they look like ON THEIR SIDE.

A partner's customer was receiving links to our dashboard: a product
they do not have. The first fix made the ADDRESS follow the tenant — insufficient,
and the partner's code proves it: **none of its paths look like ours**
(`/network/<org>/knowledge/<id>` where we serve `/docs/<id>`), and for some
of our views it has **no equivalent** — its tables do not exist. Gluing our
paths under its domain would thus have manufactured dead links, which is worse than a
link to our brand: a dead link cannot be diagnosed, it can only be endured.

Hence one pattern per link TYPE, declared by the tenant, and a simple rule:

    no pattern ⟹ no link.

**Two families, and confusing them breaks a flow**:

- a **DISPLAYED** link (a table, a shared page) may not exist: we write
  nothing rather than send somewhere. `link_for` then returns `None`, and the caller
  omits the link — it always has enough to be useful without it.
- a **REDIRECT** (the return from an OAuth connection) must ALWAYS land: we
  cannot "not redirect". Without a pattern, it falls back to ours — the user
  sees our brand once, which beats a blank page in the middle of a
  connection. That is `redirect_for`, and it is the only path that falls back this way.

⚠️ **Updated 10/09/2026 (oto#63).** The partner described above now has
a table page; until its tenant row declares it, its accounts
receive `null`. A BARE `null` said "not found" to whoever read it — hence
`raison_sans_lien`, which says why the address is missing, and `patron_reclame`, which
only charges an expensive parameter (the caller's org) to the product that requires it.
