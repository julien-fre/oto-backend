"""Resolution for an ANONYMOUS MCP endpoint (ADR 0032) — the org-only mirror.

Extracted from `resolve.py` on 2026-08-29 (500-line ratchet, #584): it is a path in
its own right, with its ADR, its callers (`subdomain_project`) and its tests — not
a branch of the identified path. It shares the walker and the return type, nothing
else.

⚠️ **The tenant tier, here, ONLY comes from an edge** (L-keys PR 2). A caller's
tenant is read from their qualified sub, and the anonymous caller has none; reading the
project org's attachment is precisely what a resolution path does not do (lot
L1). It is the walker that looks for the live tenant→org edge (`grants_chain.
tenant_for_org`); without it, the cascade stays `org > platform`.
