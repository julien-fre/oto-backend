"""Who has the RIGHT — access governance, outside resolution (ADR 0031/0038/0044).

Three families, all GUARDS or ENUMERATIONS, never a resolution:

- **tool visibility** hidden by the org_admin or the team lead (0031);
- **instance sharing**: the level guard of a pinned instance (0038 B6)
  and the named loans `share_side` (0044);
- **instances within reach**: what a call token could legitimately reach, so
  that the "nothing resolves" error surfaces the choices instead of a bare refusal.

Added to these is `resolve_field_filter`: the REDACTION policy of the active org —
same nature (what the org governs applies to the actor), another surface (the
response fields rather than access to the connector).

There is no more connector RBAC (ADR 0025/0012 B2, removed 2026-09-24):
reserving a connector for part of the members no longer exists. Restricting means
PLACING the key at the right level (ADR 0053 D1) — a personal key is only resolved for
its holder, a team key only for the team's members.

Depends on `scope` (role, context, membership) and `cascade` (the list of
org-shareable connectors). Does NOT depend on resolution: it is resolution that
calls these guards.
