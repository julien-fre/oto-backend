"""What the grants chain POINTS TO — the 0053 resolution, isolated (batch L7).

A read that is impossible RAISES: it never means "key absent, try further
down". Only the comparison observer may absorb an error from this chain.

**Why this module exists separately.** It is the half of the batch that SURVIVES: when
`walk_cascade` is removed (PR 3), the observation and its counter disappear, but
this stays — it is the served resolution. Keeping them in the same file would have mixed
what we install with what we throw away.

**What it computes**, as [0053-D2](blueprint) lays it out:

1. the **reachable set** — the instances of the scopes the subject is a MEMBER of,
   plus those that come down to them through a live `grants` edge;
2. the **designation** — the call that names an instance and the procedure binding
   take precedence, but they already short-circuit the walk upstream (`resolve`), so
   what remains here is **proximity**: `user > group > org > platform`.

There is no restriction on top: 0053-D1 — restricting means PLACING
ownership at the right level, never laying a prohibition on top (the `connector_acl`
table has not been read since 2026-09-24).

**Two method rules, held mechanically:**

1. **No rule is copied.** The connector's notches are read at their SOURCE —
   the registry (`is_byo_user`, `org_shareable`, `auth_modes`), an instance's
   suspension, the `grants` edges. This module writes a different TRAVERSAL, not
   a second copy of the gates. Same discipline as
   `connectors/instance_visibility.py`, which already inverts the walker without cloning it.
2. **The designation concerns the TIER, not the account.** The choice of a
   multi-identity account is a notch of the instance (0053-D9), not an authorization:
   `rung_for_pick` delegates it to the PROBE that `resolve` composed, and never
   replays it.

    Returns `(pick, hors_modele)`. Unlike `grants_chain.platform_rung`,
    no `CHAIN_CONNECTORS` gate: L7 makes the chain the sole authority, so the
    question "what about a connector that has not been switched over?" is precisely the one
    we measure. Edges are read by the SAME function as the served path
    (`db_grants.edges_for`) — not a copied query.

    **`hors_modele` names the NUANCE of the hole**, and it is no longer a boolean. A vault
    row can grant in two ways the chain cannot yet express, and
    they have neither the same remedy nor the same reading:

    - **open to all** (`share_mode='open'`, no allowlist) ⟹ the "everyone" edge
      is missing;
    - **closed on an allowlist** (`share_down`) ⟹ the NAMED edges of that
      allowlist are missing. L5's seeding only covered `CHAIN_CONNECTORS`, so
      every closed key outside that list falls in this case.

    Distinguishing them is not a refinement: without the second, a perfectly
    explainable divergence fell into `inconnu` — the class that must stay at zero
    to allow the removal — and closed the door for a wrong reason. Seen on
    2026-08-29: 17 observations on `aiark` and `apify`, two CLOSED keys granted
