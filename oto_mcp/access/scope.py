"""Who acts, and in what context (ADR 0023/0038) — the LOW layer of the package.

Three questions, one place for each:

- **the platform role** of the sub (`member` < `admin` < `super_admin`);
- **the call context** — EFFECTIVE org, team and project, resolved
  `call token ?? view ?? home`; `current_org` is the single seam
  through which everything that scopes an action passes (credentials, visibility,
  entitlements, redaction);
- **what the active project PINS** — identity, instance, table slot.

This module depends on no other `access` submodule: all the others
start from it. A function that needs to know "for whom, under which
org" calls it — it never re-reads the home (`org_store.get_active_org`)
directly, cf. `tests/test_org_seam_tripwire.py`.
