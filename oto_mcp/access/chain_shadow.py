"""The DOUBLE READ of L7: the chain computes, the old path decides.

**What this module is not.** It decides nothing, refuses nothing, does not change by a
single byte what is served. It observes. The only visible effect of its existence is one
more row in `access_shadow_l7` — and, the day the window is conclusive, the
right to flip the authority (PR 2), then to remove `walk_cascade` (PR 3).

**What it computes.** The resolution as [0053-D2](blueprint) lays it out:

1. the **reachable set** — the instances of the scopes the subject is a MEMBER of,
   plus those that flow down to them through a live `grants` edge;
2. the **designation** — the call that names an instance and the procedure binding
   take precedence, but they already short-circuit the walk upstream (`resolve`), so what
   remains here is **proximity**: `user > group > org > platform`.

Neither path knows an access restriction on top: 0053-D1 —
restricting means PLACING ownership at the right level, never laying a prohibition
on top. The `connector_acl` table has not been read since 24/09/2026 (the `restriction_acl`
class, which counted its refusals, left with it).

## The discrepancies we can name in advance

Prod survey of 2026-08-29 — they are not anomalies, they are the decisions of
0053 becoming visible. A divergence that fits none of them is `inconnu`,
and it is the only one the window must see at zero.

| class | what produces it |
|---|---|
| `elargissement_equipe` | the cascade only reads the **ACTIVE** team; the reachable set reads **all** the subject's teams in the org. A member of "finance" active in "sales" resolves nothing today and would resolve finance's key tomorrow. **Counted per org**, because it is a served behavior that changes for a named customer |
| `free_tier_hors_modele` | the old path wins the platform rung through the OPEN free tier (`share_mode='open'`, empty `share_down`) — and 0053 has **no** "everyone" beneficiary. It was the only real hole in the model; **decided on 29/08: an explicit "everyone" edge first, the measured phase-out connector by connector afterwards.** This class must therefore fall to **zero** before the removal (PR 3), and it is the edge laid in PR 2 that brings it there |
| `partage_hors_modele` | the platform key is CLOSED on an allowlist (`share_down`) **and no edge expresses it**. Sister of the previous one, different remedy: it is the NAMED edges that are missing. L5's seeding only covered the switched connectors, so any closed key outside that list falls in this case. Experienced on 29/08: 17 observations on `aiark` and `apify` fell into `inconnu` for lack of this name — a perfectly explainable divergence that closed the door for a wrong reason |
| `perso_cross_org` | the personal cross-org instance (#172): the cascade follows the subject's key in ANOTHER org, 0053's reachable set is scoped to the context org |

## Two method rules, held mechanically

1. **No rule is copied.** The connector's levels are read at their SOURCE —
   the registry (`is_byo_user`, `org_shareable`, `auth_modes`), an instance's
   suspension, the `grants` edges. This module writes a different TRAVERSAL, not
   a second copy of the gates. It is the same discipline as
   `connectors/instance_visibility.py`, which already inverts the walker without cloning it.
2. **The comparison is on the RUNG, not on the account.** The choice of a
   multi-identity account is a level of the instance (0053-D9), not an authorization: replaying
   it here would duplicate `_shared_auto_account` to produce a false discrepancy.
   Wiring the resolution to stable instance identifiers is PR 2.

⚠️ **Switch**: `OTO_L7_SHADOW=0` turns everything off (no read, no write).
It is the reversibility lever that does not require a deployment, only a
restart — like the box's other environment levels.
