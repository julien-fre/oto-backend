"""What a resolution RETURNS: the winning credential, its origin, its config (ADR 0024).

Extracted from `resolve.py` on 2026-08-29 (500-line ratchet, #584): this is the type
that ALL resolution paths produce — the identified path (`resolve`), the anonymous
path (`resolve_anon`), the pinned instance — and it depends on none of them.
Placing it at the bottom of the package is what lets those paths be sibling
modules without a cycle.

    - `config` (lazy): declared NON-secret fields (data_center, base_url…) ∪ the
