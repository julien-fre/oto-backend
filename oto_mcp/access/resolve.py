"""The REAL resolution of a credential — the hot path (ADR 0024/0038).

`resolve_credential` is the public view; `_resolve_credential_impl` walks the
cascade ONCE with the fetch probe (only the winner is decrypted) and returns
a `ResolvedCredential` (key + origin + non-secret config). Three paths
short-circuit the walk, in this order of specificity: the instance pinned
by the call (`_instance=`), the one bound by the project, then the cascade.
`resolve_anon._resolve_credential_anon` is its org-only mirror, for the published
MCP endpoint (ADR 0032) where there is nobody whose default account could be
taken; the returned type lives in `resolved_credential` (both extracted from here on
2026-08-29, 500-line ratchet, #584).

Depends on everything below it: `scope` (context, project pins),
`rbac` (instance guard, error hint), `cascade` (the walker),
`quotas` (the platform tier's ceiling). The thin views built on top of it
(`resolve_api_key`, `resolve_credential_fields`…) live in `views`.

    SINGLE function for the pair: the refusal above, the read-only probe
