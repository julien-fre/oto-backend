"""The keys of a SHARED project: what its beneficiary can reach (#480).

**The rule — Alexis's ruling of 2026-09-23 (option A).** Someone a project is
shared with works in it **with their own keys**. The owner's keys
(those of their org, and of their team for a team project) are lent to them only
if the sharer **explicitly granted it**, at share time, and never beyond the sharer's
own rights. "Iso whether the share goes to a member, a team or an org": the
same rule, the same parameter (`credentials`) and the same behavior for all three
beneficiary types — nothing here looks at which type of grant the caller came in through.

**The hole it closes.** `_project=` co-sets the owning org as the call's context
(`call_axes._pin_project`), and the ORG rung of the cascade was guarded by no
membership: a beneficiary outside that org acted under its org keys,
without anyone having decided it. The team rung was already guarded
(`can_read_group` at pin time); the org one was not.

**What "their own keys" means**, under `_project=` of an org they are not a
member of:
- their member key in the project's org, if they knowingly set it there;
- otherwise their personal key set in another of their orgs — the personal org first,
  else the most recent (the cross-org instance of #172, extended here to every
  personal-key connector, multi-account included: same `sub`, zero impersonation);
- their tenant and their own platform accesses — never those the platform grants
  to the project's org (`org:<id>`), which are that org's rights.

**Inheritance** (`credentials="inherit"` at share time) is an edge of the grants
chain (ADR 0053) — `grants.resource_kind = 'project_credentials'`, issued by the
sharer (`grantor = user:<sub>`), received by the share's principal. It opens the
org rung (and the owning team's rung) **as long as the sharer can reach them
themselves**: the bound is re-read on every call, it does not freeze at share time.
Revoking = archiving the edge (`credentials="own"`, or `unshare`). The loan does not survive
the expiry of the share that carries it (otomata-tech/oto#39): the edge is only read for
a principal whose project share is alive.

**Cost.** The verdict is computed ONCE, when `_project=` is set (threadpool,
`call_axes`), and travels in a contextvar. The walker only reads it: zero queries
on the hot path, and a call outside a shared project pays nothing.
