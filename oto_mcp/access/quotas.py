"""What is METERED and what is PAID (ADR 0043, ADR 0070 §7).

Two distinct levels, often confused:

- the daily **quota** of a PLATFORM key (`quota_for`, `usage_today`,
  `record_platform_usage`) — a trial safeguard, lifted by the person's declared
  `platform_unmetered` right in their org (`plafond_du_jour`, `quotas_leves`);
- a connector's **paid option** (`paid_option_for`, `has_option`) — a declared
  right (`entitlements.has_right`), a single rule: the org's, or a right row
  set on the person (in the org or everywhere). The account mark
  (`option_comps`) does not open a paid option.

Depends only on `scope` (the actor's context) and `entitlements` (the declared
rights) — never on `billing`: commerce writes the rights, the core rereads them.
The verdict "is the option OPEN for this connector" (which accounts for BYO)
lives in `views.option_open`, above the cascade.
