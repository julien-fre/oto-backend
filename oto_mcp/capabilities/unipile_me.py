"""Unipile hosted messaging, MEMBER side: connect, reconcile, read, unlink.

Four hand-written routes until 2026-08-27, ported to capabilities (ADR 0009) —
same paths, same codes, same body on the wire:

- `POST   /api/me/unipile/connect`   → hosted-auth URL (or adoption of an already-linked account)
- `POST   /api/me/unipile/reconcile` → explicit poll-and-bind
- `GET    /api/me/unipile`           → per-user status, with opportunistic self-heal
- `DELETE /api/me/unipile`           → soft-disconnect WITHIN the current org

⚠️ **`/api/me/unipile/connect` is SUPERSEDED and lives until the front end switches over.** Its
successor is the generic capability `me.connector_connect`
(`POST /api/me/connectors/{name}/connect`), which returns a `FlowStart` — the shared body
already lives in `unipile_connect.hosted_auth_url`, called by both. We still port it
as a capability: debt gets repaid, and its future removal becomes one line.

⚠️ **There is no linking webhook any more**: `POST /api/unipile/webhook` was removed on
2026-08-29 (#581) — the provider had stopped calling this callback since its v2, and an
unauthenticated route with no legitimate caller gets removed. Linking goes through the
reconciliation below, under the person's JWT.

**No MCP face** (`mcp=None`). The agent face of this gesture already exists and is
`me.connector_connect`; adding a second one here would recreate, on the MCP side, exactly
the duplicate this work removes on the REST side.

⚠️ **Two fallbacks that look like bugs and are not:**
- `GET /api/me/unipile` **reconciles** before answering (it is THE linking path) —
  best-effort, never fatal for the status, and a no-op without a pending, hence with no
  network call;
- `DELETE` is a **soft**-disconnect: the account survives at Unipile and the row
  survives as PROOF OF OWNERSHIP, which makes the rebind deterministic on reconnection.
  It is per-ORG, like the display: what you see is what you disconnect.
