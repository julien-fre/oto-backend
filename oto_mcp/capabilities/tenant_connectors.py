"""The connectors a tenant OFFERS — its activation ceiling, on ITS admin surface
(2026-09-26).

A partner serving oto under its brand does not offer the whole catalog: a Google
service its Google Cloud project does not declare, a connector it does not want to
support. Until now it only had two levers, both wrong: the platform
master (which cuts for EVERYONE, oto included) and the org override (one row
per org — sixty orgs, sixty actions — and which an org admin can undo).

The TENANT notch of `connector_availability` (`connectors/activation.py`) is a
CEILING: `enabled=false` cuts for all the tenant's orgs, and nothing below it —
org override, team — reopens. `enabled=true` only removes the cut: the
platform ceiling stays its own, a tenant never exposes what the platform does not
give (same rule as the org, `_require_master_exposed`).

Three capabilities, one per gesture — list, cut/reopen, remove the row — on
`/api/admin/tenants/{slug}/connectors/activation[/{name}]`, at the floor of tenant keys and
apps (`TENANT_ADMIN_OF(slug)`: the tenant's admin OR the operator). The primary
tenant is refused: its ceiling IS the platform master.
