"""PLATFORM tier of connectors: the activation switch, and the access the platform
opens to an org or to a member.

Five hand-written routes until 2026-08-27, ported to capabilities (ADR 0009) —
same paths, same codes, same body on the wire:

- `GET|POST|DELETE /api/admin/connectors/activation`            → the activation switch (ADR 0010 B4)
- `GET|POST        /api/admin/connectors/{provider}/platform-access` → platform access (ADR 0044 §H)

This is the missing level of a family whose TWO other tiers were already
capabilities: `connectors.activation.{org_list,set_org,clear_org}` and
`{group_list,set_group,clear_group}`. Same domain, three levels, one single way to
describe it from now on.

**Both the global master and the org override take effect immediately**, with no restart:
`register_all` loads the tools of ALL registry connectors at boot, and
activation is read from the database on every request (`connectors.activation.exposed_connectors`,
by session visibility and by the call guards — ADR 0011, 16/06/2026). Until 23/09/2026 the
response carried a `restart_required: true` on the global master:
a leftover from before ADR 0011, which would have made us redeploy production for an effect
already obtained (oto-backend#815, measured on 02/09: public catalogue going from 97 to 98 connectors
without a restart). Removed, not set to `false`: an always-false field says nothing.

**No MCP face** (`mcp=None`): flipping the global master affects the whole
platform, and opening platform access is a commercial act. An agent has nothing to do with it, and the tiers a user can
actually drive — org and team — are already served by `oto_connector_activation`.

`/api/admin/*` is removed from the public OpenAPI description: a platform console has
no third-party integrator. The `Output` is used here for type generation on the dashboard side and
for the readability of the contract, not for publication.
