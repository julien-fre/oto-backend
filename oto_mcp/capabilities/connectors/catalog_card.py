"""A connector's CARD, declared — the shape served with `verbose=true` (#667).

`GET /api/me/connectors?verbose=true` serves the entire catalog row
(`providers.public_catalog()`), i.e. thirteen more top-level keys than the
compact mode. None of them was declared: `MyConnectorRow` is `extra="allow"`, so
they passed through the model without leaving a trace in the schema, which only
announced `additionalProperties: true`. A third-party front that derives its
credential form from the contract could therefore get nothing out of it, even though the data arrived —
that is the blocker reported by the REST consumer.

**These models DESCRIBE, they do not validate** (same regime as `Capability.Output`,
see `capabilities/_types.py`): the handler keeps returning `dict`s built by
`providers.public_catalog()`. Declaring therefore cannot move a byte of the
payload — and that is the only reason this batch is safe to put on a
surface that is already consumed.

**Home.** Here and not in `selection.py`: the described shape is the one produced by
`providers/__init__.py::public_catalog`, not the one the capability composes. Both
faces use it — the authenticated projection (`connectors.me`) enriches it with
`connect.callback_url` / `connect.app_ready`, absent from the public catalog served without
auth (`connectors/flow.py`).

⚠️ What is declared here must remain the REFLECTION of what the producer returns. The
producer remains `providers/__init__.py::public_catalog` and `_model.Connector.auth`:
a field added there and forgotten here becomes a served-but-undeclared field again, which
is exactly the defect being fixed. `tests/test_carte_connecteur_declaree.py` holds
the ratchet: it compares the SERVED keys to the DECLARED keys, connector by
connector.
