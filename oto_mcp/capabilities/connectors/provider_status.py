"""The access verdict for ONE connector, as `access.status_for` produces it.

Served under `providers` by `GET /api/me` since forever, and declared `dict[str, Any]`
until 2026-09-01: rich, consumed by the product dashboard, and named nowhere. A front end
building a “status” column therefore couldn't derive anything from it without observing
the payload — that is the reason for #669.

⚠️ **The written fear that kept `Any` concerns the dictionary's KEYS, not the shape of a
value**: “an open object rather than an enumeration that would lie at the first connector
added”. The keys stay open (`dict[str, ProviderStatus]`) — it is the VALUE that is
declared, and it has been stable for months.

Four families produce an entry, and their fields differ: keyed (`keyed`), keyless,
`cookie` and `oauth`. Hence optional fields **per family** and not out of uncertainty:
`identity_label` makes no sense for a keyed connector, and its absence is information,
not a gap.
