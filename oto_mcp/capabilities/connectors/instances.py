"""Capabilities "connector instances" (ADR 0038 §B, rung 4) — a READ PROJECTION of
the existing vault (degenerate case): each credential the resolution cascade can
find (member (sub, org) > groups > org > granted/open platform key) is exposed as a
**named owned instance**. Metadata only — the secret is NEITHER decrypted NOR
returned (non-decrypting readers only: `list_credentials`, grants,
`list_platform_keys_meta`). Zero new tables, zero write path,
`resolve_credential`/`status_for` untouched.

LOT L6 (blueprint ADR 0053-D9, R1 settled on 27/08): each projected instance now
carries, IN ADDITION to its `ref`, the STABLE identifier from the
`connector_instances` table (`id = "inst:{n}"`). The projection remains what it was — a
vault read, zero decryption, zero writes: the only addition is **one** query
that translates the vault quadruplets into identifiers, fail-open. Nothing else reads
these instances yet (neither the cascade nor the resolution); `ref` remains the
reference to pass back (the pin guards refuse `inst:` by name, see `access.rbac`).
PIECE 2 (28/08): the instance is now born at SET time, in the vault transaction —
this projection did not change by a single byte, but its `id` is no longer missing
because of key freshness, only because of fail-open. It also serves `visible_to` (R9,
settled on 27/08): the scopes that DISCOVER the instance, derived from the access
chain by `connectors.instance_visibility`. ⚠️ **Descriptive, not filtering** — the
list is neither widened nor narrowed, and a non-member still sees "no key configured".

EXCLUSIONS (deliberate, documented):
- `entity_type='user'` residues (legacy scope of the former atlassian/folkmcp
  federations, removed on 2026-09-09 — the rows themselves still sleep in the database)
  — outside the working cascade by design (ADR 0033);
- account grants #55 (`connector_account_grants` = satellite identity
  pointers, already served by `oto_account_access`) — folded into
  "shared instances" at B5;
- remote Unipile identities (`connector_identities`: enumerating them decrypts
  the key and calls the remote API) — the BYO key itself IS listed as a
  member instance.

LIMITS (documented):
- the `config_fields` packed INSIDE `secret_enc` (e.g. zoho `data_center` set via
  POST api-keys) do NOT come out (reading them = `unpack_secret` = decryption);
  only the (public) `meta` part is projected as `config`. The real B5 table
  will unpack at write time.
- no activation/exposure filter (ADR 0031): resolution doesn't apply one
  either — the instance exists even if the connector is not exposed
  (deliberate divergence from `oto_connector op=list`). Along the way the projection lists
  what `status_for` ignores (org grant, free-tier): it is the honest mirror of
  what resolution would find.
- NO `wins`/`mode` (the winner is still told by `status_for` — a single
  truth): the §C preference is carried by the SORT member < group < org <
  platform. B6 will make this order literal.
