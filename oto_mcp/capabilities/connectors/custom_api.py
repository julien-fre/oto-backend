"""What the CONNECTOR capabilities say about the org's custom connectors ("Custom API",
connector `http`) — kept out of `selection.py` and `instances.py`, which are over the
500-line ceiling (`docs/conventions.md`), so that the Custom API grows none of them.

- `repli` — the way out of a "no such connector" refusal: connect the tool through
  Custom API, with the setup link pre-filled with the searched name (never a secret).
- `projection_for_name` — `oto_connector(name=…)` for a name that is no catalog
  connector but the label (or account) of one of the org's custom connectors.
- `stamp_instances` — the `custom_api` card of each `http` instance in the roster
  (`/api/me/connector-instances`).

The data itself (definitions in `connector_instances.config`) is read by
`connectors/http_operations.py`, the one module allowed on that key.
