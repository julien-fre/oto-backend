"""Capabilities "connector selection" — marketplace (ADR 0019).

Per-member, scoped to the active org (`SUB_ONLY` injects `ctx.org_id`). Three distinct
facts (cf. `connector_selection`): exposure (`connector_activation`, the ceiling),
proposal (`orgs.default_connectors`), selection (`user_selected_connectors`).

- `connectors.me` (read) = the catalog exposed for the active org, merged with
  the per-member state (`not_selected` | `active` | `paused`) + `recommended` (org baseline).
  Single source consumed by the dashboard (library + "my connectors").
- `connectors.select` / `.pause` / `.unselect` (mutation) = installs / pauses /
  removes a connector. Guard: refuse a connector not exposed for the active org
  (the `connector_activation` exposure ceiling is never relaxed).

SYNC handlers (the adapters don't await). NOMINAL regime (ADR 0050):
"not selected = hidden" — seeding a new (sub, org) installs the curated
`default_active` base; selecting/pausing takes visibility effect at the next
session (`session_visibility`).

    computed AT THE HANDSHAKE (`session_visibility.compute_hidden_tools`, called at
