"""Capability "get the link a Microsoft administrator opens to approve oto".

Many organizations forbid a person to authorize an application alone: the connection
then comes back `admin_required`, and the card offers this link — to copy and send to
the organization's Microsoft 365 administrator, or to open if one is an administrator.
The administrator approves, for their whole directory, the permissions of the chosen
Microsoft services; nobody's token comes out of it, each person then connects from the
card as usual. The answer comes back on the card: `?connector=<card>&connect=
admin_approved|admin_refused` (`api/microsoft._retour_approbation`).

The gesture lives with the connector (`auth/microsoft.admin_approval`); this capability
routes, guards and translates a refusal.
