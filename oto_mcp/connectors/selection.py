"""Connector selection by a member — “marketplace” model (ADR 0019).

**Three distinct facts, not to be confused** (cf. ADR 0019):
- *Exposure* = `connector_activation` (who CAN see, platform governance,
  deny-by-default, admin-only) — the **ceiling**.
- *Proposal* = `orgs.default_connectors` (what the org RECOMMENDS, advisory).
- *Selection* = **this table** (what the MEMBER installs in their space), per
  `(sub, org_id)`. This is the new state the marketplace introduces.

Three member states, per connector:
- **not selected**: no row → stays in the library/catalog.
- **selected-active** (`state='active'`): tools visible (normal visibility).
- **selected-paused** (`state='paused'`): installed but tools hidden.

The table is the **source of truth for selection**; *visibility* stays
computed (`tool_visibility.is_tool_visible` unchanged) — the middleware derives an
additional masking from it (pause/non-selection), never on PROTECTED_TOOLS nor
grant-only. `org_id=0` = personal space (ADR 0015 sentinel), like `user_disabled_tools`.

NB rung **B1**: table + helpers only, NO caller reads it yet — deployment canary
(no-behavior-change). The wiring (reading `/api/me/connectors`, mutation,
pause masking in the middleware) follows in B3/B4/B5.

Convention: self-managing (they open their own connection, like `connector_activation`).
Only `init_schema` receives the `conn` of the `db.init_db` transaction. No oto_mcp
import at module level (leaf) — `db` imported lazily.

    mattered. Lived result: whoever removed WhatsApp found it installed again at the next
