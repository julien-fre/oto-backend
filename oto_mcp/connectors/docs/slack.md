## prerequisite — you need a Slack app installed on your workspace

oto does not yet have a published Slack app ("connect in one click"): you create **your** app in your workspace and paste its tokens here. A one-time task per workspace, ~5 minutes.
- **bot token** (`xoxb-`): read channels, post under the app's identity. This is the default token.
- **user token** (`xoxp-`): post **in your name**, and search (`search:read` only exists as a user token). Optional.
- either one is enough. With **both**, oto reads with the bot and makes you **choose who writes** on each send: `author="me"` (in your name) or `author="app"` (under the app's name) — with no choice, the send is refused rather than going out under the wrong name. The response says who wrote and in which channel, and whether that channel is shared externally.
- otherwise, an admin can grant you your org's platform key

## setup — create the app by pasting a manifest (the shortest way)

1. go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → choose **From a manifest** (not "AI agent" nor "Starter app": those are conversational-app templates, unrelated)
2. choose the workspace. The editor that opens is **already filled** with an example (`display_information: name: Demo App`): **select all and replace it** — pasting over it without clearing welds the two manifests together and Slack refuses ("Nested mappings are not allowed in compact mappings"). The manifest to put in its place, which already declares all the scopes the oto tools need:

```yaml
display_information:
  name: Oto
  description: Reads and writes in Slack for your Oto agent
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: Oto
    always_online: false
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - channels:read
      - channels:history
      - channels:join
      - groups:read
      - groups:history
      - im:read
      - im:history
      - im:write
      - mpim:read
      - mpim:history
      - users:read
      - users:read.email
      - chat:write
      - reactions:write
      - files:read
    user:
      - search:read
      - chat:write
settings:
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

3. **Create**, then **Install to Workspace** and authorize
4. in **OAuth & Permissions**, copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-`) and, if you want to post in your name, the **User OAuth Token** (`xoxp-`)
5. paste them here — nothing else to configure

*(without a manifest: **Blank app**, then declare the same scopes by hand in OAuth & Permissions before installing. The manifest avoids exactly this step.)*

⚠️ **a scope does not replace channel membership.** without membership, Slack answers `not_in_channel` — which wrongly looks like a token problem. two cases, and only one can be automated:
- **public channel**: `slack_join_channel` gets the app in on its own (this is what the manifest's `channels:join` scope above is for)
- **private channel**: no Slack API lets you invite yourself. a human who is already a member must type `/invite @Oto` in the channel — oto cannot do it for them, and says so instead of letting you believe it's an outage

## setup — a second workspace, a second installation

a Slack token is issued **per installation**: two workspaces = two independent sets of tokens. Redo the installation in the second workspace (same manifest), then set its tokens as a second workspace of the connector (section "several workspaces").

## usage — what you can do

send and read slack messages from claude — in your name or under the app's, depending on the tokens set.
- "send a message in #general" → `slack_post_message`
- "dm jean by email" → `slack_find_user_by_email` then `slack_open_dm` then `slack_post_message`
- "read the latest messages of this channel" → `slack_read_history` (top-level messages; `oldest`/`latest` to read only a window)
- "what was said in this thread?" → `slack_read_thread` — a thread's **replies**, which `slack_read_history` does not return (it only shows the count)
- "get oto into #channel" → `slack_join_channel` (public channels only)
- "react 👍 to this message" → `slack_add_reaction`
