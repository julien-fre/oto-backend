## prerequisite — authorize Google Drive on your Google account

from this card, click **connect**: Google asks you to authorize **Google Drive only** (scope `drive`) on the account you choose. the Google account itself (address, token) is carried by the **Google Account** connector — one account can authorize several services, one service at a time, without reauthorizing the others.
- several Google accounts: each tool acts on the one the call names with `_account=<email>` (the tools' `account=<email>` is the same choice — two different addresses are refused), otherwise the one the project pins, otherwise the default; an unknown address is refused, never replaced by another, and the response names the account that served (`_account`); `google_accounts` tells which ones have authorized Google Drive
- an account that has not authorized Google Drive is refused by the tools, naming this card — come back here to authorize it

## usage — list, read, organize, share

`drive_file(op=list|get|download|move|delete…)` and `drive_access` — under the chosen account.
- "list the files modified this week in the `clients` folder"
- "read this `.xlsx` from my Drive, `quotes` tab" — a spreadsheet comes back as CSV per sheet, bounded; `sheet` picks the tab, `max_rows` the bound
- "put the .xlsx this service produces into my `suivi` folder as a Google Sheet" — `drive_file(op=upload, source={"kind": "http", "path": "/export.xlsx"}, parent_folder_id=…, convert=true)`: oto fetches the file itself, the formatting is kept
- "share this folder read-only with jane@…"
- "export this Google Sheet as `.xlsx` to send it" — `drive_file(op=export, format=xlsx)` keeps every tab and returns a signed URL to the file ; `csv` exports the first tab only, inline
- "take our Slides deck as a template and build a new one in the same design" — `drive_file(op=export, format=pptx)` returns a signed URL to the deck as a `.pptx` (`docx` does the same for a Doc) ; the new file goes back with `op=upload, convert=true`
