"""The "connect" gesture of a connector — declared by its module, derived everywhere.

**The problem this closes.** Some connectors cannot be obtained by pasting fields:
they need a gesture outside the form (OAuth consent, browser session…).
Nothing DECLARED it, so each surface compensated in its own way — and always by the
connector NAME. The dashboard mounted the consent widget behind a
`['zoho','zohodesk','zohoanalytics'].includes(name)`; Salesforce, which has exactly
the same shape on the backend side (start capability, callback, the two
`status_hints` hooks, the `oauth_flow` factory), simply was not in it — so no button,
and a customer could not finish their connection. Adding one more name would have
worked for five minutes and grown the one thing that had to be removed.

**What the seam guarantees.** A connector declares its flow HERE, in its own module
(pattern `connector_verify` / `status_hints`). The catalog derives a descriptor of
SHAPE from it — which parameters the user must provide, what the gesture is called —
and the front renders a generic form + a button, without ever knowing a name.

**What the descriptor deliberately does NOT carry**: no URL, no capability key, no
tool name. `/api/connectors` is served without authentication; a descriptor that
published its internal paths would make the attack surface a side effect of the
documentation. The path is FIXED and known to the client
(`POST /api/me/connectors/{name}/connect`), the name travels as a path parameter.

    type comment (`-> {"auth_url": …}`) that nothing enforced — a third flow
    would have invented its third key. The published contract had to be declared open
    with two optional fields: it documented the inconsistency.

    **The first level is CLOSED, and it is the only one the caller may write**:
    `auth_url` to open in a browser, nothing else. Whatever a connector wants to
    echo in addition goes down into `details`, a NAMED field whose content is its
    own property — same rule as on input (a connector's specificity lives in its
    module) and same choice as `ResolvedCredential.config`. Freezing the union of
