"""Connector activation tier — DB governance (ADR 0010, decision 4).

**Declaration (`providers/` registry) ≠ activation (this table).** A connector
declared in code is NOT exposed merely by being declared: an activation row is
needed. Resolution, the scope ladder taking precedence from nearest to widest:

    exposed(connector, org)  = org override if set, else platform master, else OFF
    effective(team member)   = exposed(org) − team cuts (restrict-only)

**SINGLE table `connector_availability`** (ACL workstream, scoping 10/07 — merge of
the former pair `connector_activation` + `group_connector_activation`): the grain is a
scope COLUMN, not one table per grain.

- **('platform', '')**      : platform master (global switch).
- **('org', <org_id>)**     : org override — forces ON/OFF over the master.
- **('group', <group_id>)** : team cut — `enabled=FALSE` ONLY
  (MONOTONE invariant ADR 0012: the team cuts, never exposes; the business
  guard lives in the capability).
- **no row**                : OFF at the org level (deny-by-default), inherited at the team level.

**One-time seed** (platform rows): the connectors in the registry AT THE TIME the
tier was introduced are activated; later ones stay OFF until explicit
activation. **Legacy copy at boot** (guarded by `to_regclass`, newer-wins on `set_at`):
the two historical tables are copied over as long as they exist — they drop
in B2 once this code is promoted (shared canary/prod DB).

Convention: reads/writes are **self-managing** (they open their own
connection, like `db.*` and `org_store.*`). Only `init_schema`/`seed_initial`
receive the `conn` of the `db.init_db` transaction. The module does NO
oto_mcp import at module level (leaf, like `providers`) — `db`/`providers` are
imported lazily to avoid any cycle.
