"""Is a credential AVAILABLE to me? — per connector, across the whole catalog.

Born from oto-backend#1112. A user's agent told them their LinkedIn was not
connected while it was (`linkedin_unipile_account op=status`:
`connected:true, alive:true`). It had not called the status tool: it had read
`state:not_selected` on the catalog row, and understood it as "not connected".
Nothing on the row said an account existed. Twice, for two users.

**Three axes, never confused** — each has its own surface, and none speaks for the other:

- **selected in the toolbox**: `connectors.selection` (`state`). Governs the
  VISIBILITY of tools, nothing else — a `not_selected` connector is still callable
  through `oto_call` (ADR 0036);
- **credential available**: THIS module. A key or account exists for the person
  at some level of the cascade (personal, team, org, tenant, platform);
- **verified alive**: never computed here. A session can be dead at the provider
  while the account stays linked; only a probe says so, and it costs a network
  round trip. `next_step` NAMES the tool that verifies it.

**Single source: `access.status_for`**, the snapshot `/api/me` already serves to the
dashboard (PRELOADED presence probe, one in-memory walk per connector, no
decryption). No cascade is recomputed here: the dashboard, `oto_connector` and
`oto_list_my_tools` therefore read the same fact. This module, and only this one, is
what the two agent surfaces call — a second derivation would reopen the contradiction
of #1112 (the tool catalog said everything was "installed" while the card said
"not selected").

⚠️ This is NOT the fitness verdict (`connectors/readiness.py`): that one also reads
the paid option, the quota and the recorded rejection, connector by connector
(~244 ms each). Here we answer a narrower question — "is there anything to
authenticate with?" — but across the WHOLE catalog, because the catalog is where the
agent was drawing its conclusion.
