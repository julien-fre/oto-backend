"""Google OAuth — web flow, per-user, tokens persisted in SQLite.

Flow:
1. Authenticated user (Logto JWT) calls `GET /api/google/oauth/start` →
   we return a Google URL with an HMAC-signed `state` containing their `sub`.
2. User redirected to Google, consents, redirected to
   `/api/google/oauth/callback?code=…&state=…`.
3. We verify the state, exchange the code for a refresh+access token,
   persist it in the encrypted vault (`connector_credentials`, connector='google').

To use the credentials (tools side): `credentials_for(sub, account, service)`
chooses the account by the common resolution (`access.resolve_credential`:
`account`/`_account=` > project pin > single > default), transparently refreshes
if expired, returns a valid `google.oauth2.credentials.Credentials`.

Setup ops:
- Env `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLIENT_SECRET` —
  OAuth client of type **Web application** in Google Cloud Console. The backend
  emits `{OTO_MCP_PUBLIC_URL}/api/google/oauth/callback` as redirect URI: this
  EXACT URL must appear in the client's "Authorized redirect URIs", otherwise
  Google returns "invalid request" (redirect_uri_mismatch). Since the ADR 0040
  cutover (2026-07-06) the client is shared prod + preprod → declare both:
    - `https://mcp.oto.cx/api/google/oauth/callback`    (PROD)
    - `https://mcp.oto.ninja/api/google/oauth/callback` (PREPROD)
- Google Chat (`chat.*` scopes below): in the Google Cloud project that holds
  the client, enable the Google Chat API AND configure it (Google Chat API →
  Configuration: name, avatar, description, interactive features
  disabled). Without this Chat app, every write under the user's
  identity returns 404 "Google Chat app not found"; reads do without it
  (otomata-tech/oto#190). Also applies to the project of a tenant that sets its own app.
- Env `OTO_MCP_PUBLIC_URL` (already used for Logto) — base for the
  redirect URI; locally it can be overridden to point to localhost.
- Env `OTO_MCP_OAUTH_STATE_SECRET` — HMAC secret to sign the anti-CSRF
  state (generate with `python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))'`).

**A TENANT's app** (23/09/2026) — a partner who wants THEIR OWN consent screen
(their brand, their Google Cloud project, their scopes verified under their name) sets their client
as the **publisher app** of the `google` connector, in the tenants' namespace
(`editor:tenant:<slug>`, `credentials_store.tenant_app_key`): from THEIR dashboard
(`tenant_apps`, `PUT /api/admin/tenants/{slug}/apps/google`) or by the operator
(`POST /api/admin/editor-apps {connector: "google", data_center: "tenant:<slug>", …}`) —
REST only, encrypted vault, never the env. Once it is set, `app_for(sub)` serves it
to every account qualified under this tenant, and the callback goes to the first host the
tenant HOLDS (`tenancy.callback_host`, e.g. `https://<host>/api/google/oauth/callback`):
it is THIS URL that the partner declares at Google — their client only accepts their own
domains, not ours. With no app set, the tenant stays on ours and on our
callback: the previous state, byte for byte.
⚠️ **A token only refreshes with the client that issued it.** Setting, changing or removing
a tenant's app makes the tokens issued by the previous app unusable. The issuing client
is recorded on the token (`persist_token` → meta `client_id`; absent = our app, that of
all tokens from before this batch): a token from another client is refused BEFORE any network
call, account marked, "reconnect this account" — never purged. A client refused by
Google at refresh (`unauthorized_client`/`invalid_client`) is a named
`GoogleClientRejected`, not an internal error — and not a dead grant (config ≠ revocation).
⚠️ The tenant's host routes to ONE instance (prod): a consent started in
preprod with the tenant's app calls back to prod — the state is verified there with prod's
secret. Testing a tenant's app means doing it where its host lands.
